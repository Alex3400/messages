Small world

In script?

cyrillic
but

 :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark:

I will likely not have done much
But okay  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
ok

No die of shame games folder either  :pensive_face:  :pensive_face:  :pensive_face: 
it took me a while to understand that
shame games really just include candy crush
i am on level 3000 something
3332 to be exact
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
Wow
That's impressive
What a gamer
Tetris and candy crush destruction slay
I started in 7th grade
Gamer since *DAY 1*  :face_with_steam_from_nose:  :face_with_steam_from_nose:  :face_with_steam_from_nose:  mega slay

 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
gauravs corridor smells like weed
I have been told
what have you done today
so far
Uh
Woke up
Ate
And slept
It's tooooooooooooo lit
so you're basically living my life
yep, living the dream  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: 
mhm
how was the show
riverdale was bad as always
betty and archie's only dialogue was "let's make a baby”
and then the other show was good
it's about this guy whose gf disappears and said gf had a mysterious past
and a lot of things happen
we didnt finish it cause gaurav was tired
Idk who these people are but xd
 :pensive_face: 
i am also having a minor existential crisis but  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :pensive_face: 
currently not passionate about anything
i do not know what to do
but i am ignoring it
I've been doing that for 18 years
I'm just crusing
It's going well
 :loudly_crying_face: 
God
also i sent u three tiktoks
2/3 girls you have already seen
? Im cruaing
Cruising
but the last one
you might be cruising but i am not
omg the last one
she's wearing a tie over a dress
i am such a fan
Unlucky I'm sure you'll find something soon enough
thanks
Also
I was telling Gaurav
I only have one regret about Yixin moving out
ok so
in dec we were talking about spotify wrapped
and he refused to tell me his top artist and said it was embarrassing
i made a bunch of guesses
was wrong
and he said he'd tell me on the day he moved out
and ngl i still wanna know
Ask him?
Hes already left?
Yeah
He left like three days ago
Bruh
Why didn't you ask
OHHH
i didn't realise he was moving out
I think
Saulet told me he was moving out
I'm not 100% sure
But I think
The chronically online thing you said before I knew you
Was something like
he moved out*
Parnovski goes brrr
Or something maths related go brrr
Ohh I think I said Open book exam goes brrr
Truly deveststing
Because Dima said sth
Yes that's right
Like
"I dont even know the formula for Cauchy's term by heart but I'm not the one taking the exam so you will have to learn it”
and I said
"Open book exam goes brrrr”
That's a fair thing to say
Wasn't there a meme about male manipulator music
what ??
Yixin probably listens to that
lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
i was gonna say that "tbh i dont think he's a male manipulator” then i remembered that he told me that he literally read a book on how to influence people to become president
<Media omitted>
yeah he was saying "i came to nutford w the intention of becoming president”
Bro what
he said he was in halls in 1st year
Who goes to a student halls with the intention to do anything
and being president sounded so cool
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
and he was in a flat in 2nd year
In what world does president of Nutford sound cool
so when he came to nutford he came in wanting to become president
What does it even entail
and he started by organising the trip to fabric around move in day
and zhengze messaged him being like "hey thanks for organising this”
and then he tried to get to know everyone so they voted for him
And that's when he started his campaign
Omg
Is this on his linked in
he said of the all the votes
he got over 50%
Wow very impressive
and david wanted to become president
and martha also wanted to become president
but he said "clearly i had the most votes”
so they let yixin brcome president
yixin has beef with david
<Media omitted>
yep
not even incoming financial whatever
Well I mean if he got the most votes
For trying to be president
this
but also yixin was dj at the first boat party
????
but david wanted to dj instead
Bro what
yeah
Bro what again
He said david kept trying to one up him
Bunch of weirdos in our house
Also he doesnt like octav
I was also not supposed to tell anyone that he doesnt like octav
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  scandalous
I remember saying something to him
Even more scandalous
in Early Dec
But also, you were getting close secrets
cause he wasike
You were pretty close :face_screaming_in_fear: 
"everyone's still here right”
and i said
"oh the ram ppl finished early”
and he's like "well it's good if there's less ram ppl right”
and i'm like ???
and he explained
Oh
Ram people as a whole
"the ram ppl are all friends with david so they dont like me”
idk
Lmao why so much drama
i couldnt quite call him a friend
we didnt make proper plans ever
i just ran into him a lot and talked to him a lot
Yeah I guess Nutford makes for strange dynamics like that
Yeah
He'd come to the study room a lot and talk to me
Omg
I just remembered something
He came into the quiet room looking for Jani
But I was the only one there
He'd come to the study room just to talk to you
and he told me he'd just signed his investment banking contract
 :cowboy_hat_face: 
And I was like oh that's cool
and he was like "since you asked so nicely i'll show you my contract”  :skull: 
and i never asked
 :skull:  that's kinda funny
I'd do that
Like if I was more arrogant
It's the sort of bit I would do
and if it had been anyone else i'd have said "i never asked”
but i didnt
It's clearly a bit
and i was like "oh no this is not looking good”
Yeah
also made me question whether i was a gold digger or not for a second
 :face_without_mouth:  :upside-down_face: 
Is he loaded?
no
???
he's gonna make £55k
per year
without bonuses
and i read that and i was like "ooh”
and then i was like
"am i a gold digger???”
That's not that insane
i know
Good for entry though? I guess idrk
it is good for entry i think
uk starting salaries are super low
I mean
Being into yixin for his money is better than his personality
 :skull: 
It was personality first
Ngl
I am gonna go die
My grandpa calls my mum a gold digger
it's always personality first
Because we bought a house in California where they used to dig for gold  :skull:  :skull: 
It's a pretty good joke
 :skull: 
lmaooo
that is a good joke
so far it seems to be narcissists only
But
That means you have something in common with the people you have a crush on
You both like them
Clever
what?
Ohhh
That took me a long time to get
I thought you were calling me a narcissist  :loudly_crying_face: 
You're not a narcissist
You could do with a bit more narcissism
disagreed
remember me telling you how amazing i am after the suitcase thing
<Media omitted>
It's not narcissism if it's well deserved
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh did you ever watch uwu.mi on tiktok
no
Hold on
held on
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
I sent you uwu girl
i saw
<Media omitted>
Wow
Not even trying to be subtle about it
i know
okay
good night
update me tomorrow
 :white_heart: 
Ok
Goodnight
 :white_heart: 
omg
I had a dream
Relax Martin Luther king
I'm so stressed
Omg
Oh no
We were being threatened w a knife
By Ji guang yu
You me Gaurav
By some guy
He was threatening some other guy with a knife as well
He made him pick up a gun
and call his friends?
???
him as in the other guy and point it towards himself w his foot
so the gun is on the ground
?
With his foot
and the guy's foot is on the trigger
i know that doesnt totally work
but that's how it was
Ok
and we were just passing by when this guy starts threatening us w the knife as well
and tells us to put our phones down
Oh no
then for some reason there was a gun on the floor too
and he tells us to do the same thing
as that guy
The foot gun?
yes
Ah right
So we're calling our friends while pointing a gun at ourselves
there were two guns actually
With our feet
But 4 of us?
two extra guns
so 3 in total
3 of us then
Still doesn't work
Yeah
Who doesn't get a foot gun
So you and I end up standing together
 :white_heart:  foot gun besties
lmao
it's kinda cause i froze up and didn't move and you had to get me to move
so u and i ended up being foot gun besties
yw
so we're just pointing guns at ourselves
he tells us to call our friends and tell them we're about to die
Me at us, Gaurav and random 4 th guy at themselves?
yes
Ok
and you and gaurav do sth super cool and communicate without talking (or me noticing???)
 :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: 
Sorry I'll include you in dream telepathy next time
and then you guys end up running away at the exact same second
dw you didnt leave me behind
As long as you don't steal my dream gf
Nice
Good going us
and this guy is threatening the other guy w a knife
so he doesnt pick up the gun
and i think he gets tackled
but idk by who
By who?
probably you guys
Oh ok
cause nobody's there
Probably me  :relieved_face: 
and then i am #traumatised and terrified
so we end up walking some more on some street that vaguely resembles the soho street
We don't go home?
Just keep strolling
and we see a woman having hung herself
Fair enough
????
we are on our way home
Mish
What is going on
and then the guy shows up again and threatens us again
and i am so stressed i wake up
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
No knife people here
Chilling now
mhm
I think this a result of the show
and Jean
The show had this super terrifying bald guy
Oh yeah Gaurav mentioned briefly
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
and Jean saw a crime scene
A corpse
Whoah
That's scary
I know
Why always Jean  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
At first I went on a walk
Realised I want a ramen
Had a ramen
Wanted boba
Found a corpse
I'm okay
It was wrapped
this is how she tells the story
Jean  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Who just drops that in conversation like that
i mean her first text message was "i just saw a crime scene mish@
Right
and i was like ???
and she said she saw a corpse
and i asked how that happened
and then she sent that string of messages
Oh no
Poor her, is she ok
And are you ok
My goodness
Jean is ok
She's like
"It's not like I saw a bare corpse”
Right  :upside-down_face: 
I know
Why is it always Jean
I dont understand
I am ok
Just stressed
Now I'm stressed about the flat viewing
My guy still hasnt confirmed my viewing time
Aw  :sad_but_relieved_face: 
Just sent him an email bc I dont have his phone number
Where's this flat
<Media omitted>
This man emailed me on Saturday
Mhmm
Hurry tf up
I replied within an hour
And he never confirmed it
Oh no!! Only 2 days to fit something in your busy schedule  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
He said he was gonna show it at 12-1pm today
Have you been doing moreproject work?
but he said to wait for his confirmation
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Which he never sent!!!
He was like "this might be cancelled pls wait for me to confirm this before making any travel arrangements”
it's 4 hours before the viewing and he still has not confirmed it
Then just don't go, or go some other time
Doesn't really matter when you go
Loads of time left
3 months  :loudly_crying_face: 
kinda want to go today cause we have another one at 3pm
Omg so busy
and kinda want today to just be a flat viewing day
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
^ that's 3pm
ie 12 mins away from ucl
Oh these are both fairly close
Yeah
this is 30 mins away from ucl
3pm one is right by garden halls
Isn't it
How much are these?
2300 pcm
2800pcm
?
3 bedroom?
yes
Did you rope Jean into this?
jeans coming w me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  my Nutford hostage
She said she would consider
if it's a good deal
I think after having to go to QMUL
she's not as big of a fan of stratford anymore
Haha that traumatized her
But the Lizzie line
she wont even be able to take it
?
didnt you say that
Oh right you need to change at the next stop
Ugh
Annoying
yes
Whatever she can have my extra Nutford spot
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok it's sleep time goodnight
 :white_heart: 
ok
good night  :white_heart: 
<Media omitted>

I think one of them is proposing
Now im looking for squirrels

 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
Why what happened
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
the agent showed up 20 mins late
15 mins in i realised i was in the wrong place
ie before the agent showed up
Hahah
Calculated
jean never showed up
then while i was waiting for the agent and running around finding the flat
she told me that she got bad news from korea
Lmao that's rough
Oh no
so i worried
she said she herself is okay but that the news was really bad
and she heard it from a friend
so its not her family
 :sad_but_relieved_face:  hope everything is ok
but now shes not responding to me
then also while im waiting for the flat viewing
gaurav texts me asking me to remove the bg of his picture
Hahahah
i am also texting saulet
The burdens of being Editing Queen
who is in spain
because she is in contact w the agent
 :upside-down_face: 
That is a lot of things
and she tells me he forgot the viewing
But the flat looks nice !
it does
so there was a lot going on
Is this the 2300 or the 2800 place
2800
But now we're in gordrns square looking at squirrels
So all is right with the world
<Media omitted>
we are hunting for cafe food
 :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face: 
Flop :exclamation_question_mark: 
also i miss you
had a meal deal
Aw.. miss you too
so no proper food i think
even tho i gave my snack to gaurav cause he was like "i wont eat lunch till later”
 :skull: 
He skipped lunch
Some people  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i think he did
i got my meal deal and left to go to the viewing
Did the first viewing not happen
These slackers
it did not
he texted me in the morning saying "the viewing has not been confirmed”
Lmao
then why did you text me on sat in the first place??
"Hasn't been confirmed"
Just say cancelled
i know
this man was like "wait for me to confirm” on saturday
i emailed back within an hr
 :upside-down_face: 
and then he never replied
Down bad for flat viewing
Mega yikes
and then said not confirmed
i know  :loudly_crying_face: 
Wtf

that was to "mega yikes”
Mhmm

Red Mish  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
just passed a woman saying
"i just want a bloody drink”
agreed
Agreed!
What's the temperature today?
I thought it cooled down after it was 33 ( :skull: )
t is 22
which is not that bad
but sun
Ah what thats reasonable
<Media omitted>
Preaching to the choir here
Whatever that means
Thought it sounded cool
wasit cool
are you impressed?
oh totally
lets goooo
also a very jake thinf to say
thanks
just passed a woman in the tiniest vehicle ever
its just a seat
and a steering wheel
it's like a cube
i love those cars
they're v cool
they are v cool indeed
i think saulet being away
makes me adapt some of her traits
i saw a couple making out right next to me
my first thought was not "get a room” but "why am i alone”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
 :sparkling_heart: 
at bryanston sq
I don't know the street names
the all boys sch
with the red door
can you hear me
no im guessin
oh sorry wrong person
gaurav?
yeah
just saw a tiktok of people's everything being professionally cracked
but this guy speaks in such a tone
that makes it sound sexual
ohh like bones
that was very confusing for a second
send the tiktok
lmaoo
mish wtf
how does this sound sexual
that is terrifying
hes going to pull that poor womans leg out of the socket
he sounds asmr-y
he's whispering
he is not
hes speaking in a soft tone
would you rather him
<Media omitted>
that didn't work lol
is this the joke?
<Media omitted>
i thought the joke was him not sauing anything
oh no
wait
lmao
that was on purpose
thats funny
my comedic prowess knows no bounds
idk i used to watch this other guy who cracked ppls everything
he spoke in a matter of fact lecturer-y type of way
well idk
I feel like this is an activity you're ought to be relaxed for
that is fair
and getting stressed becuase he soudns like your professor which reminds you about school which reminds you about courses which reminds you about exam results
probably not a great combo
Oh No.
Oh also Alex
yes
My phone case broken strand thing fell off
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: v

I'm going for a bike ride to sacramento later

I was dubious after we tried it in drumnadrochit
but this is actually very good
yeah
repertoire
hmm
its the one with the bit about the free banana
also
converting my office friends to brooklyn 99
right
Good Job  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
<Media omitted>
it's sad that i thought of representation theory
immediately before i saw the picture
 :woman_scientist: 
also the other possible reply was gonna be
"not representing me because i have lost all passion  :upside-down_face: ”
 :crying_face: 
but decided that that wasnt gonna be a very happy thing to say
I was thinking about that earlier
<Media omitted>
this is v accurate
im on the staircase
indeed it is
I could know you're on the staircase
 :smiling_face_with_horns: 
yeah
that's not that bad
i'm at dinner
the only two people here are the guy who always wears the n95 mask and the receptionist
oh no
nutford house is empty  :loudly_crying_face: 
it is indeed
very sad
did gaurav say sth about going to dinner when you guys ended your call
i messaged him
but i dont have the patience of 2 mins to wait
we called while he was in regenets park then he left at 6
to get to dinner at a reasonable time
oh ok
did he go to cafe nero before your call
yeah he did
ok
free drinks  :partying_face: 
i was thinking if he didnt he probably went to cafe nero after your call  :loudly_crying_face: 
danke for the gaurav info
de nada for the gaurav info
but its been long enough
we talked about depressing things so he might be having a _moment_
oh no
is he ok
did he decide to skip dinner as well
I don't think so
has he read your message/is he online
he has not read my message
 :pensive_face: 
but he has been active since i sent my message
<Media omitted>
 :face_without_mouth: 
look at the chocolate cake today
yeah wow
thats some high tier stuff from nutford
I know the food doesn't taste that good probably
but I miss the nutford dinners  :loudly_crying_face: 
nutford dinners miss having you at them
 :smiling_face_with_tear: 
 :smiling_face_with_tear:  indeed
ok
he said he'd come in 5 mins
he is not skipping dinner
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
but you're not here  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
jean has posed you the corn question before right
yes
she is wrong
I remember my answer had to do with number of rotations
http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/08/analysis-vs-algebra-predicts-eating.html?m=1
and Jean and Beatrice just plugged their ears and claimed they were right with no supporting claims
yeah you showed me that too haha
I know
even though I also go on vibes
If you have supporting evidence
then I'm down for that
I know what it was
less rotating
less finger work
but I was only considering the vibes
Yes
I mean that's not why I chose to eat corn that way
But if we're going to have an argument
About the mathematically correct way
They can eat it
Pun intended this time
(and every other time)
that was actually good
You keep saying actually good. They're all actually good!
Except for the ones that aren't ofc
<Media omitted>
i have the urge to say "that was actually good” to this but it's not "that was actually good” level but it was still alright
Aktualy  :nerd_face: 
oh my god
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
the word actually reminded me of yixin
he always says akshually
Lmaoo
like he told me "bro youre akshually insane”
Oh no
Oh no indeed
Why's everything reminding you of yixin recently
Bit disconcerting
Has Gaurav arrived yet
just did
it is
even tho genuinely 0 feelings
ok
ok
0 feelings except curiosity about Spotify
I'm kinda curious now
Can you ask
No
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
if it's the weeknd though
that would go w the male manipulator tiktok
see
now i kinda wanna know
but
i cant dm him to ask about this  :face_vomiting: 
if i had seen him leaving and then asked
that wouldve been fine
Just DM him
You'll never see him again
absolutely not
He's not even a real human anymore
Can I DM him
that means he'll know i discussed him w you
absolutely not
Once you stop taking to people
he has a decent memory
They stop becoming real
You'll never see or talk to this person again
Trust
this is such a you thing to say
And since I'm right all the time
also why are you moving so fast
It's also such a right thing to say
Bike
at the station
Mhmm
So
Are we dm-ing him or no
no
Ok ok
I see what you're saying
But consider this:
Please ?
Very convincing
But still no
Ok ok ok ok
But
Have you considered
The following argument
Pretty please  :white_heart:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:   :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
even more convincing
How about:
but
no
"I'm doing a stats project on people's top Spotify wrapped artist could you help out"
that is so obvious
i cant even find his spotify
even jani doesnt follow him
actually i havent looked
Lmaooo
For sure
I actually never looked for his spotify
Until like
10 secs ago
Wow
High tier self control right here
i did not find it
i know right
but also finding ppl on spotify is much harder
than anything else
Jani found you  :person_shrugging: 
Yanny
I thought his name was yanny for wayyy too long
Hahaha
through saulet
and Jani doesnt seem to be following Yixin
What's your Spotify name
gmisheel
Everything is private on there anyway right
Not very Incognito
No
I was under the impression you made everything Incognito so when people look you up they don't find anything
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Because we tried to internet stalk you and found nothing. Of value
That's a lot of things
not so interesting tbh
some playlists are public
but thats just bc i forgot to make them private
To share your fire tapes with the public  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
and i wasnt that bothered
Generous queen
Oh maybe that
Nah my thing is better
ok
some playlists have 2 songs
That's a lot of songs
I know
<Media omitted>
Hahahah
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
mostly cutesy
Crushy?
They're v upbeat
and happy
and cute
and all about love
"wife me"
so I say
crushy
Haha fair enough
Idk many of these but afterglow isn't very crushy
ok

Ok ok

And my phone was dead so I couldn't take a picture
But look
<Media omitted>

 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:

You're being set up  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
<Media omitted>
lmaooo
5271 miles away  :loudly_crying_face: 
i know
i saw that
it was so sad
Think you can get a terimesu mcflurry then keep it in the fridge for 3 months for me
 :exclamation_question_mark: 
if i was going to mcdonalds then yes
but i am not
 :exclamation_question_mark: 
Well I'm not sure you could do that if you were going to McDonald's
tbh
i could probably keep it in a safely closed freezer
box in the freezer
Where would you get a freezer
and have it go not totally bad
Also where are you going
Chicken valley  :double_exclamation_mark: 
Where this time it won't be a problem if they only have 2 left
lmaoo
argos
<Media omitted>
rip
<Media omitted>
hahaha
cheesebakes
?
i was gonna come up w a joke
realised i could not come up w a joke
decided not to proceed
You just messaging me cheesebakes then not elaborating for 5 minutes is joke enough for me
that worked out for me
your phone is about to die
This is true
<Media omitted>
bike ride was hot
im going to start crying on your behalf
that is way too hot
also way too hot to be on a bike
oh no
im imagining the sun
awful
I have returned to inside with air conditioning and ice water
Good 4 u

looking happy and healthy  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

my pop culture knowlege has increased 50 fold since meeting you and saulet
proud  :white_heart:

by the way, if you wanna talk about the whole no motivation thing, lmk
thank you alex
<Media omitted>
My dad prefers analysis and eats it the vertical way
interesting
What are you doing today/what have you done
i am in the primark changing room
 :double_exclamation_mark:  cool
i woke up
then i ate
then i went to primark
Imagine if you manage to fit sleeping into your schedule later
i know
That'd be insanity
yep
we decided against the flat
 :pensive_face: 
I can include all bills if you £3000pcm
^ reason
Bills are around 60 per month per person?
yeah
and also
generally
its not that gr8
and i think we should keep looking
Ok just so u know I have few viewings today
after i told him wed let him know later
Oh you have like an agent thing going on
yeah the agent was showing us around
That's nice
i mean
Have you convinced Jean to choose flat over Eleanor rosa
the agent is diff for every flat
jean is at a conference
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  girl boss

 :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :soft_ice_cream:  :cold_face:

just joggers
and light summery trousers
No summery trousers in Primark?
light summery dress was obtained

Show?
Is it weird to use the maps thing
It feels weird to know you're in the body shop without you telling me
no
<Media omitted>
even if its black
also cropped to not show the mess of clothes in the back
 :skull:  :skull:  :skull:  no way you're embarrassed about having a bunch of clothes in the changing room
found sth really nice but not gonna get it
Really something else
but its going on my list
You have a list
yes way
That's ominous
of fragrances
Dress is very pretty tho
Ah do you remember the scents
yes
danke
Right that's normal
omg
gonna get distracted again
crochet hook
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
This is important distraction
some of my yarn arrived
got the email
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
while i was in the changing room
Wait so did you see a store with a crochet hook
That you need
we're about to find out
saulet said that poetica said that john lewis has yarn
Fun and exciting
so im gonna see if they have hooks
That wouldn't surprise me
<Media omitted>
they do
 :party_popper:  :party_popper: 
their yarn section is amazing
Do  they have the yarn you bought online
<Media omitted>
no
this is super expensive yarn
Dang you got some fancy yarn
like 17 per ball
my yarn was 3.80 per ball
how big is your thing going to be
i ideally want hex size but that's not gonna happen
1.5 of hex?
bigger than hex  :loudly_crying_face: 
omg
they have embroidery floss
i am fangirling
you mean
string?
it's called floss idk why
but yes string
I think its pretty clear why its called floss, its floss shaped
and that sounds better than string
but yeah string
do you do embroidery?
ok
kind of
am v bad at it
but i made a portico
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
ill show u when im back in mongolia
doubt
you mentioned once
idk if you ever showed
I think I have somehow managed to catch a cold in 35 degree weather  :upside-down_face: 
rather impressive if you ask me
how??
<Media omitted>
I maintain that getting a cold has little to do with the weather
aww
and not preordered yarn
return the yarn
re sell the yarn
but im gonna console myself knowing that my yarn is softer
 :loudly_crying_face: 
mega slay yarn

"yolo in the middle"
<Media omitted>

yes
ok leaving john lewis
and hoping to god that my yarn is super soft
manifest
you yarn is super soft
yes
what are you gonna do today
maybe buy shoes

i think 39 degree weather is appropriate splashing weather
i would kill myself in 39 degree weather
 :crying_face: 
ok sorry
<Media omitted>

 :pensive_face: 
4 jogger legs
Have to read the whole thing then
its ok
give me 8 mins
Consider it given
v grateful
ok
can i call
No
I think its alright to not be super passionate about everything all the time, like you can't expect to always have a very clear direction for what you want to do and have everything planned out. I get that it can be stressful to not know where things are going, especially when it seems like you've been pretty directed for the last 3-4 years but theres nothing wrong with taking life as it comes. Additionally, maybe having no direction or passion is an issue if there is geniuenly nothing for you to do, but you're still in university, you have two more years to do cool things and meet new people and find out about new things. Finally, you're genuienly a very very intelligent person,

My mum is surprised you don't know how to ride a horse
Lmao
Oh no
I'm gonna go home
and ride a horse
because I am 100% convinced it's not difficult
and that it will just come to me
as long as you aren't scared
which it seems like you aren
Yes
bing chilling
Horses smell fear
so I have been told
did you turn off your location
No?
Oh yes
My bad
yay
I will not move for a while
Rather uninteresting if you ask me
ok
You can track me to target later
I am trying to learn how to magic circle
?
because thats the first raccoon step
Oh
and idk how to magic circle
I thought you were doing a ritual
<Media omitted>
attempting it on unimportant yarn
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
definitely
In telling the yarn you said that
oh no
the yarn will hate me
Omg
I learned a magic circle on regular yarn
Oml
Whoah
But it's so much more difficult on the fluffy yarn
and it's not just me
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
You can do it
so I'm thinking of just making a regular circle
Special crochet lady
No the thing is
I do
it
but then you're supposed to pull one end
and i cant pull the end
without ripping so much fluff out
 :pensive_face: 
so im thinking of doing a regular circle
Has anyone been able to do it
they published an alternative methods for the magic circle
If I'm tbh being honest
for this yarn
Idk if it'll be that deveststing if you use normal circles
there might be a hole in the middle
Such is life
It's like Socrates said
but it still piles up
Life is like a donut
There is a hole in the middle
Idk what I'm going on about
i think that socrates did not know about donuts
There's no way to know for sure
What are you gonna do ask him?
Checkmate
right
- dima about dirichlet
Haha he did do that
Show me magic circles
Or non magical circles
in a bit
 :smiling_face: 
i smell weed
In your room  :exclamation_question_mark: 
no
Where
opposite duke of york
What're you doing there
was walking home
tir flurry
tir flur for short
ok
 :O_button_(blood_type):  :key: 
Circles  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Please
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Oh no
<Media omitted>
That does look very sad
That looks good!
Danke
So you make a bunch of circles then layer them on top
Or do you like do a shell in the pattern then fill it in
this i think
i am not 100% sure what you're talking about
but i am also not 100% sure what i'll be doing
Well what are you doing then
Because you said something about following a patter on the outide
I am starting over
Outside
Oh the raccoon
Yes
Basically I need a circle
Do you have a grand plan or are you still sort of figuring things out
and then I'll be able to follow along the tutorial
ideally a magic circle
Is magic circle going to happen
I dont think so
 :pensive_face: 
But I am yolo-ing a circle rn
It's a yarn issue for sure
YOLO  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
<Media omitted>
Thank you pop culture teacher
Ms.mish
no problemo
Wow she knows all the cool slang too
Where does it end
i'm not that old alexander
No way you just called me alexander but didn't bother to capitalize the a
yes way
also this yarn is difficult
 :loudly_crying_face: 
On both accounts
i need to get used to it
Special crochet slay Queen
:)
Yooy
i am gonna take a break for now
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Not going too well?
It's very difficult to tell where stitches are
It's much easier w regular yarn
I'll get used to it
Mhmm
but for now it's just annoying me
Do you need to get in the stitches each time
Yes
Right
You can do it  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Eventually
This is a very good addition
I am known for my good addition
Actually not true
math student for sure
Arithmetic escapes me
24 hour clock
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
No need for that
That's more subtraction than anythhing
Taking away 12
Depends
Or is it adding -12?? or if you're going from 12 hr to 24 hr
Adding negatives is subtraction
ok
Why do you sometimes wait long periods of time before hitting me with the ok
Are you thinking of a clever response then giving up
Cheesebakes
i try to think of sth to say other than ok
ok
Whoah
Lightning quick that time
Didn't even have time to send me hilarious cheesebake based joke
i know
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
closer to this
but that's not gonna happen i think
so i'm gonna live w whatever the outcome is
Definitely doing it though
I think it'll look cool
yes
for academic girl autumn
Academic girl autumn  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
Do you think it'll be lighter or darker than this
darker
but it's gonna do the sunlight thing
where it'll look super red
I feel like that's cool tho
Because you don't notice it most of the time
Then suddenly
Bam, edgy cool kid with red hair
edgy  :loudly_crying_face: 
i did that w purple ends at some point
in 10th grade
Ok
where it's not noticeable
Show
Right now
bji
Is that Mongolian for yes?
Or russian for yes
Or German for yes
Or English for yes
I'm waiting
Probably texting someone you like better
On an inferior platform
yes
you on tiktok
Damn
Tiktok Alex > WhatsApp alex
Dream Alex tho >>>>
Was me pointing the gun at us with my foot a plus or minus
Because on one hand
Gun
On the other
I'm including you  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  yw
Including me so instead of suiciding you suicide-homicide?
Yeah but the knife guy would probably throw a fit if you weren't being pointed at
Then I tackled the guy
So really
that is still unclear
Dream Alex firing on all cylinders
I'm assuming it was me
That's the sort of thing that gets you hot girls to make you jealous
Waiting here as well
ok you're right but hot girlfriend was pre gun
Yeah but it's the dream Alex behaviour
Mindset
right
Still texting that Alex character in tiktok?
scrolling through
trying to find pics
i am like beatrice

I've looked at your camera roll
You have so many pictures
Not a single picture from 10th grade

Okay fair enough
 :pensive_face: 
I am trying
Out here

<Media omitted>
That is very faint
<Media omitted>

But i actually dont have any pics in the light
<Media omitted>

Somehow messenger decided to delete a bunch of pics as well
Oh well
Looking forward to red hair Mish
indeed
Wait
This is a long shot
But does little sister have red hair
oh my god alex  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
no
Omg Mish
My friend was asking
Don't know why you have such an attitude
this wouldve gotten you a deadpan stare in person
That's comforting
ok
also joyce's friend seems to have moved into nutford
bc i thought she was staying w joyce
but i heard them talking and the friend say "im going to my room now”
Ohh
Fun and exciting drama  :cat_face: 
it's not even drama  :loudly_crying_face: 
This is what we've been reduced to since everyone left
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
god
yes
also this is why i'm bringing up yixin
because i have unpacked about everything
except his stuff
Wait what
i know no other secrets  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
You have his stuff
no
Emotional stuff
I just never brought up incidents w Yixin ever
Oh right
I see
So now that there are no incidents happening
Man
I am bringing these up
I need to start some drama with my friends here
Everyone's too unproblematic
Lmao
yeah everything is so wholesome about your life back home
cute family
group of friends that have been friends since 4ever
Cute family, and Johnny!
 :skull: 
i have a flow chart of friends
and separated parents who talk more to each other than my dad talks to me
and sisters who send me mouldy applesauce
Oh come on your sisters are adorable
Other stuff, ok maybe
they are
This message was deleted
i found this
how can someone be this unenthusiastic
this was 1 pound back then
the price has now tripled iirc
Hahah idk why but this picture is really funny
Oh I know
It's the deadpan stafe
Stare
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why's it gone
lmao
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
because u backstab me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Kind of fair
But
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
ie there is always stuff happening
not that my life back home is awful
<Media omitted>
but there is always drama
in anything
but it somehow still manages to be boring
babies
 :skull: 
Senior citizens actually
<Media omitted>
i wont hear it
omg
the hat
Yee haw
Oh No
I saw an ad for stranger things
Out July 1st
and i was like thats ages away haha
then turns out it's 10 days away
then that means
results day is 17 days away
I cant deal w this
Mish
actually 16
How did you go from stranger things to results  :loudly_crying_face:  :skull: 
cant even do simple addition now
Oh no
Sorry I disappeard, my entire family just got in a car crash
They're probably ok
dont even joke about that
My bad
No victorious characters
Should make a list on my phone or something
I got the die of shame game tho
And I got a few drafts
Being bored really helps with opening up  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
drafts of what
Tiktoks
Oh
Lmao
Yeah
Even if they were view once
The Mish move  :pleading_face: 
Like
I don't even know the characters
So I really gain nothing from the info
But when you first revealed the fact you wrote them at all
Come back
You explicitly said you *won't* reveal the characters
Totally wouldn't have asked otherwise
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
mhm
Tori and Beck
Saulet said that this was embarrassing
Don't know who those people are
I preferred the labour and beck ship personally
cause it was the typical nice girl - hot boy combo
But that's just me
lmaoo
but the one in the show was jade - beck
aka mean girl - hot boy
Oh beck is a boy
Nice girl hot boy is embarrassing?
I suppose I would have to watch the show to get it
it's kinda boring
I wasn't planning on watching it lol
i meant the ship
is boring
in the show he actually kisses her after him and mean girl break up
like a few episodes later
The logical follow up here is to ask to read the fanfic, but I won't bother, maybe a few years down the line
ie tries to kiss her
Immediately after?
What a man whore
Lmaooo, remember when you called yourself a whore
That was funny
and the nice girl is so nice that she says "i cant do that to mean girl she's my friend” even though mean girl is always mean to her
She wanted to tho
Ugh
i remember that
6 ???  :loudly_crying_face: 
Just that popular
They're projecting
For sure
we will not count huaiyi and beatrice bc they know i am not with either of u
Do they ?
Beatrice does
Huai yi?
He just said we have chemistry
I dont think he'd say that if he thought we were together
That counts
That's basically they would be a good couple
I think that just means he thinks we'd make a good couple
Yeah but Beatrice said Gaurav and I'd be a good couple
so does that make 4 for both mish-alex and mish-gaurav
You're just trying to get your number down
Plus
That makes 8 then
I think huaiyi counts for more since Beatrice knows us better
Huai yi is just ovserving
?
how does that count for more then
8 for me
rather than 6
oh wait
7 for me?
Jani, mag&baptiest, Beatrice
7
Someone else for us two
No it was 6 including Beatrice and huaiyi
Oh no I didn't mean like 2 points
who else was it
Idr
yooy
now i will be annoyed till i remember
why am i not remembering
this should b easy
we dont interact w that many ppl
Yeah ikr
But the point is it's the ones you don't interact with
yeah but
tangentially
yk?
Mhmm
We have the same social circle remember
Yes
Noah
Noah asked Saulet
Oh yeah
When they went to Chipotle
And I counted it BC it was a more serious context for noah
Yes
Ok
So 6 for me
so not a mega-whore
just a whore
Lmaoooo
Not mega whore
^ this is a sad thing for a woman to say about herself
Ikr
It's 202
i think i told gaurav once "i'm just confused”
2022*
and he said
Chill with the misogyny
"that's a sad thing for a queer person to say about themselves”
themself*
Was it confused in a queer context
no
in a different context
Lmao
Especially a bi person
This is a bit of a strange question
Did you ever think you were L instead of B
why the letters ??  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  lmao
That's what Gaurav does
Taking guidance
I have weekly moments of being unsure about both
Sometimes I think do I even like men. sometimes I think do I even like women
This happens every week
Oh so bouncing between l b and s
Sticking with the letters thing
yes
usually in both directions  :skull: 
but i always come to the b conclusion
Weekly conclusion
If you do it twice a week
It's a biweekly thing  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
lmaoo

Getting similar looking tennis shoes
I am talking to my mum
Tell her I say hi  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
she says hi back
i was telling her about the fb post
also she was being mean to me about the dress
and she says you sound like you're a good kid
Aw  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Whatttttt the dress is drippy
her problems
1) it's black
2) it's from primark
and she has only heard from my aunt that primark is the cheapest place possible
and she told me to invest in quality clothes
I mean I don't think she's wrong there
But it doesn't matter it looks nice
And what's wrong with black
she said it's not summery
and i wear too many dark clothes
Never truly left tumbler phase
shh
she was like "so what did you do yesterday (ie today)”
and i was like "i went shopping”
and then i was like "im a fan of the dress”
and then the whole thing started
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
After you told her you like it
yes
she was like "i expected a flowery dress”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh I like flowery dresses tho  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
i like flowery dresses too
but the flowery dresses usually have unadjustable thin straps
and in primark there was one that i liked but 1) this issue ^
2) it was like £25
How much was your dress
£11
Did you take a picture of it
The one you liked
I did not
 :pensive_face: 
found it
<Media omitted>
Hahah well done
something like this
not quite
but the pattern was similar
bc the comments say only £15
That one looks a little tight, I like the flowy flowery ones
but i saw the straps and yeeted
Personally
Yeeted
Lmaoo
sorry
chronically online
I was more commenting on the incorrect use of yeeted
ok
ok
i was trying to look for sth like this
on an online shop
but got sidetracked by sth else
i feel like that always happens
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
this is what i got sidetracked by
have you obtained shoes
I have
They are very similar to my previous ones
good job
oh wow this is pretty
too expensive tho
definitely
<Media omitted>
those are v similar
Indeed
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
flowy
with a slit too
thats sort of cheating
artifically increasing floweyness I would say
and I am known for my dress experties
and my spelling expertiesessfjn
no see
i prefer things w slits
as otherwise i look shapeless
in most cases
?
idk why the slit fixes it
but it does
I have no idea what you're saying
Ok I think I get it
Wait
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
you can tell i have too much time on my hands
Hahahahh
What is happening
What I'm getting
Is a slit means your leg is out
And you smile
it looks better
because your leg is out
and you dont look square
or rectangle
First picture is lower case L  :loudly_crying_face: 
So it like moves the cloth to the side, fair enough I guess
Have you seen the ones
yes
Where its like
l?
The girl is the P in personality
The tiktoks
no
<Media omitted>
i was never happier
Awww
Cute
I always wanted a bunny lmao
My school in Germany had bunnies
I would ask to go to the bathroom just to see the bunnies
But also gossip w my bestie
who volunteers at the red cross
Huh
Bunnies in the bathroom
the school was wrapped around the garden
And also get denied candy  :unamused_face:  :unamused_face:  :unamused_face: 
and the bunnies were in the garden
so i'd see them on the walk to the bathroom
will always have a grudge  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
On your deathbed
"damn candy girl"
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
its like rosa
when charles didnt invite her to her wedding
Haha
Yeah that was funny
Are you going to use your skills to track her
Mayhaps
But probably no I dont even know her name
And call her in as your you're dying
When has that ever spotted you
what if she's dead by the time i die
Yeah I was just gonna say that
but then i know ways to find them
nobody puts their first grade school on linkedin
And it's likely since backstabbing bitches don't get far in life  :person_shrugging: 
oioioi
I've inherited your anger
Nws
stuck inbetween "proud  :smiling_face_with_hearts: ” and "am i a bad influence??”
You're not that much older than me misheel  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
I'll influence myself thank you very much
ok
 :loudly_crying_face: 
sorry?
<Media omitted>
It's a hard life being a Yoshi
baby  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Omg
<Media omitted>
ok but in relation to this
i think
that "i think he knows” and "paper rings” are sisters
Agreed
Very cutsey crushy as some would put it
Paper rings is so cute
the person that said that is v smart
IT IS
She is. mega girlboss as well
agreed
My fav line
which takes me back?
Yes
The one after that but yes
to the colour that we painted your brother's wall
or color
since she's yk american
 :flag;_United_Kingdom: 
She loves a London boy tho
or colour since the brother is british
but afterglow is truly my bestie
like paper rings is just like the cutesy crushy thing
Yeah
but afterglow is relatable
I'm perfectly happy with that
Is it  :upside-down_face:  has it been all your fault
idk i interpret it as her saying sorry for a minor argument where she is in the wrong and her worrying about it way too much
and looking for reassurance
also she wants him to tell her that it's not her fault
What no
The whole point is that it is her fault
And she's sorry for exploding
Accusing him for something he didn't do
it is her fault
It kinda seemed like she thought it was a big thing, "put you in jail" , "arm behind your back" obviously metaphors but still
Doing Taylor swift lyrics analysis at 2am (GMT) btw haha
(general Mish time)
good job
But I agree the bridge is very cute
but when you're worried about sth you think it's a bigger thing than it is? it sounds like it was a big thing but that's how i think of it in terms of "relating”
does that make sense?
I don't think it was like a small thing that she blew out of proportion, despite the first line, I think it's more like she accused him of something completely untrue
I realized the literal first line of the song as I was typing rhat
And that's making me rethink
Hmm
Actually I'm leaning more towards you now
Because its all me in my head
Kinda makes it seem like an overthinking thing
Ok but in your side's defense that could be her saying "I thought something untrue happened”
No but then it would be like "sorry I didn't believe you"
Because I'm imagining like she got suspicious or someone told her he cheated and she exploded and he denied but didnt believe it, but that doesn't totally add up with "it's in my head". I think you're right it's just a little overthinky thing
I think she got suspicious
Have we switched sides since the beginning of this debate
ie being close w some other girl or sth
and she mistook it as emotional cheating
no but I am considering a different side
I will always relate to it in a "I am overthinking” way
hopefully not in the og alex way  :loudly_crying_face: 
But that's not the sort of thing you have a big realization that you're wrong, it's more gradual emotional trust thing
Neither is it a thing you "put someone in jail" for
if they had a fight
God we're really nerding out
and she didnt listen to him
and just ranted at him
we are  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and then later she notices how sad he actually is
But agian, that feels like immature behaviour but not something like the jail or arm analogy works, because it's hurting his feelings not accusing him
But it really lines up with "I blew things out of proportion now you're blue"
Ehhh actually
Put you in jail for something you didn't do lines up as well
Literary analysis queen here
(normal analysis queen too)
Hah
Analysis 3  :loudly_crying_face: 
Shhhh
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Life happens we move on
<Media omitted>
Ok
But anyways
Agreed
Afterglow is relatable bestie
Paper rings is cutesy crushy
Mhmm
London boy is my London vibe
I Think He Knows is more crushy
London boy is indeed a London vibe
I think he knows is very crushy but less cute
Cornelia Street is nervous crushy only bc of the "i'd never walk cornelia street again”
Which isnt bad, it's also really catchy
Yes
not crushy
Telling a story
happy in love
Crushy? It's quite definitely sad
but also nervous
sad??
Yeah it's like reminessing about old times
The whole street is too painful
What?
No
She says "I hope I never lose you”
She's telling their whole story
Oh wait
I'm an idiot
Daylight is such a happy confident song
enlighteningr
Haven't heard it much
^ pun unintended
Will listen now
Pun unintended means your comedic talent is just naturally overflowing
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ok but hear me out.
Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince is the girl you want to be
You'll have to explain that one
I understand this sentence may not be relatable
But trust me
See it paints such a YA novel story
And that's what you want your life to be like
And like
Oh yeah clearly, it's like highschool football games or whatever
yk how youd be like "id love to live in this book world”
it's kinda like that
Okay okay I can see it
Cruel Summer I interpret in two ways
Makes it all seem kinda fun
1) the og way
yeah exactly
Cruel summer I can interpret as a BANGER
aka just a summer fling where she actually really likes the guy and cant admit it totally?
2) the queer way
<Media omitted>
because of these lyrics
Ohhh
That's interesting
To be fair
The line after this is "he looks up"
I know
But still I can see that
Did you come up with that yourself or is that an internet theory
myself
Bro
that's what it reminds me of ngl
Go do your PhD in literature
but i'm p sure it's an internet theory as well
mostly "i dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you”
is like the typical thing about same sex couples
one is out the other isnt
Mhmm fair enough
But I love you ain't that the worst thing you ever heard fits too
For similar reasons
yeah
false god was one of the first songs on that album that i listened to on repeat
i never talk about it now
I haven't heard it many times
Is it good
What happened
it's slow but vibey
it's kinda about sex lmao
"kinda"
I just skimmed lyrics
Plus she's wispering
yeah
Plus there are saxophones
Not even being subtle
i was like "what do saxophones have to do w anything” then i was like oh
Wait what oh
It's not a sax -> sex joke
It's just saxaphons are always the  :smirking_face:  instrument
Careless Whisper is the prime example
please never use the smirk emoji to imply sex  :loudly_crying_face: 
oh yeah
It's not just sex
It's whole vibe is
Just
Yk
 :smirking_face: 
dududududududu dudududu dududu du
Exactly
See you get it
 :white_heart: 
Couldn't have put it better myself
wow
WoW!!  :star-struck: 
you wanted to make that joke so badly you had to set up the white heart yourself?
Well you're not gonna set me up with it out of nowhere
And it's not a joke without that setup
you could have just said sth to make me send the white heart
even tho it's a gamble between  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :white_heart: 
No but its fine and genuine when its over text
Which would make this rude
If I so it myself then it's fine
I wasn't even going to make the joke, it was just the dudududududu was funny so I was gonna say couldn't have put it better myself
Then it remembered _the white heart incident_
lmao
that makes sense
but it seems like you're trying too hard which takes away funny points  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm known for my sense making
Idk why that sent twice
think i'm more well known for that
Because I just make so much sense  :person_shrugging: 
it did not
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
 :person_shrugging: 
Disagreed
The fast white heart into the reply adds comedic value
agree to d
like gina said
I recall
Who's your fav Brooklyn 99 character
that is such a difficult question
but
i have 4 answers
Uh
Do you know what favourite means
i do
so i will list my top 4
amy = holt = jake ~ rosa
My mum just asked my dad how? And he responded hen hao (很好) which means very good!
Why ~
You had to have been there
rosa is practically as good
as the rest
but
there is something removed about her
i was in london sadly
Oh really? What're you doing there?!
Actually
Talking about b99
No time for this bit
I think Jake is really funny but his humour is too close to mine
I think Gina and Boyle are really funny
Boyle is the funniest
Is funniest not the same as favourite
my favourite lines are the "come up w a scary name? hitler”
I was thinking funniest
LMAOO
when is that
and then theres something else
2x22 the chopper
when theyre in the chopper
talking code names
2x21?
pre last episode
Does that mean season 2 episode 22?
yes
my initial guess was correct
then 2x23 is johnny and dora
<Media omitted>
impressive
Impressive
theres also a really funny line
but it's in season 5
i cant spoil
It's probably recency bias
But Boyle oil killed me
boyle oil wasnt that funny
 :person_shrugging: 
your humour is scarily close to jake's
genuinely
half the things you say
Thanks  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
the main difference is
you're not a hater like jake is
in that regard you're terry
Jake is a hater?
yeah if he talks about ppl he dislikes he gets v over the top w his dislike
where he's unreasonable
Yeah okay fair
I can imagine the head movements
lmao
i am clearly a combination of holt and amy with a sprinkle of rosa
rosa only for my deadpan stares and leather jacket
Only Rosa when chemical weapons/mcflurry cups
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Couldn't have put it better myself
Wait no
 :person_shrugging: 
Can imagine Jake doing that
and bisexuality
i remember spoiling this for you already so idm bringing this up
but i also went into the show knowing that she was bi
and the actress is bi
Oh does she not stay married to that guy
Spoiling that  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Jk
She could stay married to that guy and be bi
Wouldn't make for very interesting plot
and just come out
But yeah true
I'm halfway through that episode
It's very eventful
the one where cheddar is lost?
No the wedding one
ohh
right
A bit sudden
right
but in terms of funniest characters
def charles
favourite characters are amy holt jake
in no particular order
w rosa being just a teensy bit below
I really like Amy and Jake
They're so cute
They are
They're really cute
They're my favourite couple
like out of all the shows i've watched
always them
there's a super nerdy moment halfway through season 4
I love their "how am I attracted to you" dynamic
It's very cute
Looking forward to it
I know
Also Holt being like "is this who you wanna be with?”
that was so funny
thats the only time it happens
but it was v funny
Oh yeah that was really funny
I genuinely love Jake and Amy
I get edits of them sometimes
I thought of sending it to you but then realised spoilers lmao
Did you see the tiktok about them I sent u
Yes
 :pensive_face: 
Book mark it
ok
ok
there is one episode
that i got a huge spoiler about
i was so pissed
Season number and title please
i really wouldve wanted to be surprised
Oh before you watched it
yeah
When did you watch first time
early 2019
How many times have u wtchdd it
i dont know
i went through it several times during my gap year
like it would always be playing in the bg
at least 10 times i think
<Media omitted>
Sow
Wow
That's impressive
it is
there's also a show called new girl
it's about these people all in their late 20s
I'd but b99 in background while doing exams I'm not scared
omg
alex you are insane
these guys live together
then this girl moves in
theyre all super chaotic
but the girl ends up w one of the guys (as predicted) but it doesnt happen in a omg which one will she date typa way
like it's always clear which one she's gonna end up w
and you just gotta watch
and those two
omg
they are v closely behind jake and amy
as in this is not me telling u to watch the show but saying you watch their relationship happen
I have a lot of shows backed up
But I'll add to list
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Are they cute or funny
Is this a comedy thing?
Yes
They had a crossover episode w b99
I started watching the show to get to the crossover episode for more b99 content
totally not insane  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh what that's sick
yep
Only a little bit obsessed
mhm  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ok anyways
as much as i would love to keep on discussing b99
Maybe sleep time
and peraltiago
yes
Peraltigo lmao
especially peraltiago
they all call it peraltiago
even in the show its called peraltiago
Peraltiago
That's so cute
^ charles
It IS
Jamie on the other hand
Eh
Eh indeed
Ok
Ok goodnight
Good night  :white_heart: 
 :white_heart: 
 :blue_heart: 
did you send the heart separately on purpose
oo blue heart?
Maybe
Well if you knew the lore, you'd know that Mish originally intended to send a blue and white heart but then decided that's too much (LMAOOO)
True Mish fan over there
 :blue_heart:  :white_heart:  :blue_heart: 
That's me
are you the block of hearts that looks like the scottish flag
I meant the Mish fan thing
But yeah that too
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ok good night

Also there's such a funny thing that Charles says

That's the one I'm on :double_exclamation_mark: 
Unacceptable
Charles is so funny
He really is
For some reason I want a sainsbury wrap

Visiting Nutford  :exclamation_question_mark:

<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
mhm
they ran out of everything
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
pasta it is
It's a Tesco angle
Or not
?
Pasta acquired
?
<Media omitted>
Slay
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
pasta's been acquired
Send pasta
Pictures of pasta that is

Don't need a photo shoot
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
sorry didn't see this message
Hahaha no worries
This is a meal deal ?! That's good value
it is
ok but what blows my mind is
the smoothie and the pasta are 5.20 together
but
when you add crisps it becomes 3.50
so the value of the crisps is -1.70
ig thats also the case for tesco meal deals
but this was a big jump hence more noticable
Hmm
Not convinced that's how it works
dont tell gaurav i said any of this he will judge me
But just buy a bunch of crisps fit -1.7
And make money
i want to say sth chronically online

and it feels v weird to just ignore him being in london
Cool
Are you gonna say hi
absolutely not
we never really talked
and he's a distant relative of cmbyn girl
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
and he's the guy who said his model gf wasnt pretty enough
Absolutely not then
 :skull:  lmao
Hope you don't run into him then
Oh
lmao
You should post on your story a London thing
And see if he messages tou
lmaoo
he probably wont
That's be fun
Yeah
But rn you're awkwardly ignoring him
If u do this
Then it's mutual awkward ignorment
lmaoo
but he's gonna be here for like a month
how do i know this
you might ask
You know all  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
I don't bother asking
the answer is he posted in the mongolians in the uk fb group asking if anyone's looking to rent out a single room in ldn until august
Righhtttt you mentioned
And you didn't offer your floor? Some nationalist you are  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
god
Mhmm
What's up
how rude of me
I am gonna fall asleep
Hmm
I actually fell asleep after you hung up
Maybe you should have
I don't know
Oh
Nvm
Lol
Uhhh
Is a told you so appropriate here?
Don't care
Told you so!
I will accept your told you so
But also I was v exhausted when I woke up
Forced myself to go to dinner
Well done
Little surprised you didn't skip
What was dinner
I surprised myself too
Did not want to eat at all
Sweet chilli chicken
Couscous
Oh this is a word
Thought it was a typo
I thought, for a longer than socially acceptable amount of time, that it was goosegoose not this?!
Good chance the socially acceptable amount of time is 0 time
that's actually cute
i think it is but it's cute so it gains some epsilon time where epsilon << 1
Is epsilon > like 2 years
i think < sorry
but actually
it's rly cute
so maybe =
Nice
 :smiling_face: 
My dad does the wordle everyday and this first guess is always ariel
Oh my god
I'm gonna cry
I want someone to love me like that
Your parents are so cute
I cant
Yoooy
It is very cute
Yooooy
Unfortunately your name isn't 5 letters
Mossy tho
lmaoo
But it's such a bad guess cause you're using two s's
Not a great guess tho
Yeah
That would be an even bigger statement then
Yeah
Say yeah if your name is Misheel
Yeah
Thanks, doing a stats project

Sounds like me when you're being depressed
Because I'm right  :relieved_face: 
ok
actually
the topic is not "ok” material
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
^ consider this the initial reply
She's becoming self aware  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
was always aware
B99?
yes
finish the season
then probably watch the next three episodes because it ends the storyline
If we must  :person_shrugging: 
How are u not dead tho

She just remembers she has a sister once every day at a random time
And will just make fun of you in some way
lmao
<Media omitted>
look at what she sent my mum
Lmaooo
She's already looking at careers for you
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That's so cute
also idk what the mayo thing is
but my mums response is the exact same thing i wouldve sent
stop watching weird videos
Refresh my memory on the mayo thing
Lmao
Google auto suggest
I typed mayo
this
Went to
Mayo chicken burger
lmaoooo
gaurav  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh I didn't read the top part
Did she send your mum the same video
mayhaps
If the presumably weird hair thing
Well
no
just got an email about open days
anand isnt helping out  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :anxious_face_with_sweat: 
befriending this man seems impossible
oh well
next year  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
It'll still be fun  :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:  probably
it will be
And by fun
I mean something to do
That isn't nothing
yes
 :upside-down_face: 
indeed
Sorry if jokes are subpar am 80% sleep
It's ok
Maybe you should go back to sleep
If you're 80% sleep
You might be onto something with that one
I am always right
Ok
Good night
Goodnight
Turning off notifications so u can message
I mean
 :sleepy_face:  :sleepy_face:  :sleepy_face: 
Who said that
Message without waking u up
danke
I had nothing to do in my life and I thought of this -indra
my sister sending this from my mums phone
yooy
That's cute though, she wants to be just like you
Lmaooo
I presume she was referring to the UCL thing but putting mayonnaise in her hair
I think it was the UCL thing
And she was like
I had nothing to do so I looked this up
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Wait did u look at the general feedback?
I did
It's mostly
"Most did well”
What do you mean most did well  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
No this is really good!!!!
That's definitely a typo
I know I did not do well
Because wtf does most mean
What they meant to say
"moss did well"
We made it  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
That is such a cheesy joke
but I appreciate
Joke?
Danke
I'm sure you did sufficiently well  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Irrelevant if email typos
Omg I'm such an idiot
what?
The Japanese professor let me reschedule my meeting
Yeah
To 5pm UK time
Well actually between 5-10
So I wrote an email confirming that time and thanking him for being really nice
Then I didn't send it
Kms
Oh nooo
When is the interview supposed to be
He just now replied to the thread with an empty email just to remind me
I feel bad  :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face:  being problematic
The group interview was 2am ca time yesterday
Mine is in 2 and a half hours
Oh no
It's ok
Good luck
tbh he doesnt care that much i think?? as long as you now send an apologetic email i think its fine
I don't need luck to tell him the 3 Japanese words I know
Oh yeah, probably say I'm sorry
Good call
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I am being useless
I just sent what I was going to because it was saved as a draft
sorry
????
You just reminded me to do the one other thing in this situation
What
There is only 2 things
Confirm time, say sorry
I thought you were being sarcastic
I was one for two
No
Probably should apologize for rescheduling then ignoring him when he specifically takes out time for me
Lol
yeah
He ignored my apology email  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
This is probably a sign he doesn't care
I cant tell
If you're being serious
??? I'm being serious he just said let's meet 5
BC I sent the schedule email
Ohhh
Then a "sorry for being the worst ever" email
Right
Oh no
Then he sent a email with a teams meeting
Then an email say, yeah let's meet at 5
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I thought you just meant he hadnt replied yet
Uhhh
Is this the professor who's teaching the module?
Oh haha yeah I can see that
Idk
Hopefully not lmao
If not
dont worry too much
Just apologise again during your meeting and then he'll probably nod or something
You know
I was expecting something over the top here
This is actually exactly how it's going to go
Thanks  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Yeah
and then he will ask you "have you ever learned japanese before” and then you can flex your three words
Yessir, ko knee chee wah my guy
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
"mum come pick me up in scared"
indeed
<Media omitted>
lmaooo
yes
like the 15! strawberries in some shake
or something like that
That's a lot of strawberries  :anxious_face_with_sweat: 
I know
<Media omitted>
Oh wow
That is impressive amounts of bordom
my peak of solitaire
was during my gap year
I've never seen anyone play solitaire with actual cards
also after my a levels
i brought cards in and just played solitaire
Brooklyn 99 and solitaire
Sounds like a good afternoon
Yes
Exactly that actually
Id watch b99 and play solitaire
Or a good 70 or so afternoons
mhm
I'm gonna fall asleep
Is that a "I'm tired and going to take a nap" I'm gonna fall asleep or a "I'm so bored  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: " I'm gonna fall asleep
1st one
Ok, goodnight
but idk if i'll actually nap
20 mins maybe
Did you win
no
 :loudly_crying_face: 
What's your win rate
idk
i use cards
so i cant tell
uhh
You don't keep track?
like 1/3
And then develop strategies to improve?
I'm starting to think you're not every trying to go to the solitaire world championships
sorry
no
i kinda just yolo
You recognize the irony there
i do not
Yeah I'm kind of a YOLOer  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  when I'm playing solitaire I don't keep track of win rate  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: 
Very Amy moment
Thank you
lost again
i am #done
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
even tho by my v bad probability
deductions
You'll win the next one  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
i should play once more to win
Do it  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
2 late
i have cleared up the cards and have filled up the space that was occupied by the cards
what are you gonna do today
other than the interview
Eagerly await the 3rd and final rematch between you and the cards
what is going on with you and misclicks
today
Wasn't a misclick
it wasnt?
mistap?
Realized my phone was low
Haha
<Media omitted>
random charachter had too much screen time, got suspicious
Omg
Yes
there's also b99 content in the matching new girl episode  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
i was so happy to see that
 :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
bc i watched that episode a year after finishing b99
also this means youve watched all the coral palms episodes
Omg you must have gotten very excited at that
"boost my bottom”
Yes
Hahah yeah
my favourite part
Ep 2 coral palms:
Why did Hitchcock get so down bad as soon as s4 started
<Media omitted>
I love this episode
Whore
why do i barely know anything about ep2
Detained by security team is Jake is like I've never been arrested, unless you count being detained by Taylor Swift's security team
She's gonna write a song about me
OH YES
this was so good
what's the deal w hitchcock
i dont remember
He just gets mega Horny as soon as s4 starts
They got the new captain and Rosa asked for walls around her desk so Hitchcock would stop staring at her and Amy and Terry were like come on! But Hitchcock was too
Oh and Rosa was in the back and said she really really needed to pee
And Hitchcock said hot  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh yeahhh
I remember now
how was your interview
Wasn't really an interview
More like a briefing
But it was good
Didn't get to apologize for being horrible with scheduling since she barely let me get a word in
I need to learn katagana and hiragana by term start
Oh okay
that doesnt sound too bad
Yeah it'll be fine
I'm not gonna learn any kanji in year 1
Oh and its a full year course but only 15 credits
So I'll sort of have 4.5 classes term 1 and 3.5 term 2
right
How's Saulet
we are chilling in bed together
she saw a bereal of dylan and alyna of them watching tiktoks of girls and said "this is giving you and alex energy”
Lmaoooo
what else are you doing today
Nothing
sounds like a good day
Maybe if this wasn't the 3rd nothing day in a row
 :person_shrugging: 
Too hot to exist unfortunately
yoy
how hot is it
It's 38 rn?
Same as before
The bay is cooler
I'll be back on saturday
yooy
idk what to say other than pog
Pog is appropriate
ok
Okay
ok
we have not sent tiktoks on tiktok
Yeah true
ie time to move to whatsapp
so tiktok can be 4 tiktoks
Do you save videos
And have folders
no
Well you are now
B99 spoilers for me at least
ohh right yea
i can just find it by searching jake and amy *song name*
ah alright
but yes the combination of jean and gaurav talking about exams is deadly
jean makes you stressed becuase she remindes you of material Gaurav because he did well
gaurav is overly stressed but about so much more minor things
like i would like to be stressed about the things that gaurav is stressed about
jean stresses me out bc of the material
I was under the impression you did fine for these exmas
no?
no
at least not horribly
a few were "dissapointing"
and metods was bad
just compared to analysis 3
lmao
but everyone did bad on methods
im wondering whether i'll pass methods 4
and whether i'll pass fluids
I thought fluids went well
and whether i'll even get 60 on analysis 4
it did not
relative to how you thought it went
it could have went*
ok maybe
but now im thinking i made a shitton of mistakes
ahhh
ok ill stop
and saulet and gaurav talked about prestigious masters programmes
you _probably_ didn't
i am there like  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
It litteraly doesn't matter
if you wanna stay in academia, which you tottally can, then where you go doesn't matter because its all about your big brain girlboss research
and if you don't, plenty of carreers will take someone who speaks 4 languages and came from Mongolia to a prestigous undergrad school abroud ( I can't spell  :loudly_crying_face: ), then did a masters in another foreign country
either way
it'll be all fine for you
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
tell me I'm wrong
thank you
ong you can't
i just gen feel a bit directionless atm  :victory_hand;_light_skin_tone:  :kissing_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :victory_hand;_light_skin_tone:  but it'll pass hopefully
and i will stop complaining
its fine
but generally all of this talk stresses me out to the max
nothing wrong with being a scalar for a bit
and once you get vectored up, I'm sure you'll have a great magnitude  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
cute jokes
thanks

this just popped up on facebook
so idk how updated or legit this is
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
but the joke deoesn't really get old
it doesnt
I'd belive it
Hampstead is the deepest and the only one I've seen with a lift instead of an escelator
and the depth is really intrestign because the lower ones are harder to build, are louder and take people, albeit marginally, longer to get to, but are much faster
the victoria and norther line operate at around 50km/h if I remember correctly while the circle and district are around 20-30
right
big differences
oh wow
50kmh??
mhmm
If I remmeber
that's a lot of kmh
that might be wrong
oh sorry
50 mph
which is 80 km
thats even more
lmaoo
very exciting
and how fast is elizabeth again
oh wow metropolitan line is even faster
up to 60
96kmh
I'm assuming thats only for the suburban areas because it extends far into north west london
so us central londoners have little use
yeah that makes sense
<Media omitted>
ayayay
fast
we love the Elizabeth line  :purple_heart:  :purple_heart:  :purple_heart:  :purple_heart: 
mhm
idk how im gonna get to heathrow  :skull: 
my flight is at 8am
oh no
ie i need to leave at 3am
it might be a stay overnight moment
are you doing 4 hours early
thats a little much  :skull: 
i also have a layover at frankfurt
3 hrs i think
even when they were understaffed I got through in 1:45
im mongolian  :skull: 
idk
but i will not risk it
?
is that a mongolian thing
get to airports early
not just mongolian
from what you've told me about mongolian air development
but im talking
i cant just scan my passport
it kinda seems like airports aren't a mongolian thing, period
and do whatever
thats once you land
they don't really check passports on the way out
right?
they do
but it depends
on where you're going
oh yeah but the earliest you can get to the airport is 6am
germany might be either way  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
wasnt it 5?
I doubt they'll grill you super hard on the way there
nah the earliest elizabeth line train is 5:30
so you get there at 6
but if i take an uber
which i dont wanna do
but also getting there at 6 is dangerous
my flight is at 8am
you might have to arrive there the night before
and just exist in the terminal for like 8 hours
which terminal are you
yours might have a piano :D
2
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
im gonna be so dead on arrival
its not that bad
staying the night in the terminal is fineeee
you could also take the night bus
<Media omitted>
but thats leaving at 3
15 hours of travel time
feel like at that point you're better off getting there the night before
 :upside-down_face: 
although
 :loudly_crying_face: 
ill see
its in august
I got to the airport then landed in SFO ~45 hours later
yooy
Dont even talk about that
look at screenshot i sent, editited it for august
id have to wait several days for another
flight to mongolia
yeah
but they'd give you a hotel
and you'd be in frankfurt
you cant tell me that wouldn't be fun
if i can enter germany that is  :skull: 
oh yeah  :skull: 
i think atm i cant bc i dont have enough approved shots
oh yeah it was fine since USA is one country
i dont think sinopharm is on their list
i dont even know what that is
wait you don't need a visa for connection flight
okay
look at it this way
if they have to keep you held up in an airport for like 3 days
imagine how much money you'd be able to get from them
its the vaccine that everyone got in mongolia
one of the chinese vaccines
ohhh right I see
and i have one pfizer as a booster when pfizer became available
does it work like that
yeah it does
I actually forgot to yell at them
my two flights are two different airlines
but they're deff gonna give me all the moeny back
you're definitly entitled to some amount of compensation
i feel like miat is not gonna give a shit
just throw a fit and you'll get money
okay well maybe if they have a monopoly on flights to europe
it has happened several times i think
then not
but
and they just dont care
id be lucky if they let me change the flight at all
as flights are completely booked
 :upside-down_face: 
as yk everyone from europe is coming to frankfurt
okay
so i _cannot_ miss my connection
but by then flights will have died down
heathrow and litteraly everywhere else was overworked because the time I went home was the normal time
your time is just so you can avoid me, which most people don't want to do
so you're bing chilling
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
oi
yoy
ok
im gonna stop stressing about my august flight
when its not even july
and sleep because i have a headache somehow
idek
im resting enough
 :pensive_face: 
but somehow still dead
is that true
8 hours of sleep
2 am last night, 3 am the night before
not doing any work
so  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
that might not be the best for you
drink more water  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
thats my professional advice
when you tell the russian school's doctor that your leg is broken:
 :upside-down_face: 
that and the ice pack
she genuinely said that to someone
no, no ice pack
who broke their leg
she just said drink water
classmate
who's now interning at nokia
oh but she actually broke their leg
yes
that was in "someone who broke their leg"
lmaoo
but okay
good to know
ok
gonna sleep
okay
goodnight  :white_heart: 
thank u for the reassurance today and sorry i keep venting about stressing
good night  :white_heart: 
its really okay
i feel like genuinely all i do is complain to you lmao
thats not true
I get cute animals, cute girls, and b99 quotes
or talk at you
true
okay
good night, talk to you tomorrow  :white_heart: 
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
<Media omitted>
aww
we just saw
one of the profs in the maths dept
right next to the bus station
that we were waiting at
<Media omitted>
like here
Yk, as you do
He's just having a night out
ahh i think he doesnt remember me
i was helping out at the open days w him
 :smiling_face_with_tear: 
but im gonna have more open days w him
so i didnt know whether to say hi or to wave or anything
v awkward
Ok
Saulet just called me a whore
Lmao
For the whole Alex Gaurav thing
I have 6
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh you just assumed he didn't know you lol
yes
You did it first
I know
I thought it was funny
It is very funny
mhm
what have you been doing
last day in folsom
I went paddling yesterday
Will go paddling/kayaking today
Tutoring in 20 minutes
That's nice
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
fun
exciting
have fun
and also yay money
at the station that you and i were at after the maths ball
i dont think ive ever been there other than that time
ah yes good times
were you more social today
than that day
bar isn't particularly high
actually you decided not to wave at a professor who you've worked with for multiple days
s
 :loudly_crying_face: 
well if going out w saulet and gaurav counts as being more social then yes
don't listen to saulet

aw
I'd say same
But I only take
The plastic bags
that like
poke into your hand
This is a rather small haul
cause they're heaving
heavy
 :confounded_face: 
it is not
I promise you it is not
I mean overall that's a lot of stuff in that right
Thing
I will show you when I come back home
But carrying stuff properly is better
But normally they're like 3 full bags
on your shoulders
Whoah shoulder carry?
not the plastic bags
but if you have those material bags
those are satisfying
I'll remember and then not use that for next time  :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: 
Harder to show off that way
Is Saulet finished packing
Almost
She's leaving stuff in the dryer
which she has to pack tomorrow
Is the suitcase full?
Did you help with your packing skills
Or did she have that on lock down
no
Gonna have to rearrange in the morning
I suspect
 :upside-down_face: 
<Media omitted>
you look like you're having an awful time  :loudly_crying_face:

lmaoo
theres a concert going on in hyde park
i can hear it from my room
Mhmm Gaurav told me
Oh wow what
Is that allowed?
That's insane
<Media omitted>
Wait what that's so loud
it is
Do you know who it is
It's like a music festival thing right
So lots of people over a long time
trying to find out
 :detective:  Mish on the case  :magnifying_glass_tilted_left: 
i think it might be the rolling stones
Oh I recognize the name
Must mean they're popular
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
impressive
kinda dont want you to cut it just so we can see how long it can get while staying fluffy and not flopping
cmbyn girl is at pride in paris
Fluffy not floppy is my middle name
Long middle name  :person_shrugging: 
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i have been viewing stories dangerously close to 15 mins
"19 mins ago”  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
ok i'll shut up
indeed
Lmaooo
impressive
<Media omitted>
i sent this picture to turuu
when he said his hair grew like "8 inches”
to show him how ridiculous that sounded
but i feel like
you're actually getting close
lmao
actually no he said "his hair on top is like 8 inches”
I think if I hold it up
It's around that much
Probably not quite there yet
But is long enough now that it is annoyingly awkward on my ears when I condition it while I'm showering
only one way to find out
wasnt that also the case like a month ago
Noni
It went over
But just like barely
Now it like, goes over then touches my face on the other end
right
<Media omitted>
I almost got my contact stuck in my eye today
lmaoo
It's actually very unpleasant
what is going on this video
Wow just no empathy for my lense
Sticking my head out the window
i can believe that
While driving
So I have this eyedrop I put in before I use the plunger to get it out
But idk I guess I had to wait a bit long or use a bit more
So it didn't loosen it enough
So I just had the plunger stuck to the contact on my eye
And the plunger is (relatively) heavy
So it pulls the lense of my iris area into like the skin under the eye
Then it falls off
So the lense is under my eye skin
And I need to use more eye drops
Then pull back eye skin and plunge the lense from there
Sorry
My friend called
Nws
How's your friend
Gossiping
Still gossiping actually
Tell me the hot Mongolian goss later then
<Media omitted>
idk
flightradar hook us up
will do
still gossiping
That sounds awful
Never wanna go through that ever
that was to the video
This is the first time it has happened
I have deep empathy
Trust me
I've been doing this for like 4 years now
Ok
ok
I am done gossiping
ok
There was a lot of gossip
Oh my god
So many people are pregnant
Mhmm, is your friend back home
Lmaoooo
She's the friend from 3rd grade
We started going to different schools starting 5th grade
Right
and she's back home
So did she tell you about people you know getting pregnant or people she knows
Yes
Either way
people she knows
But also
Her ex had a child
omg
 :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: 
I know
She's like "thank god i'm not the one carrying the child”
Yeah fair enough
How long ago was this ex
12th grade aka 2019
Because it has to be at least a 9 month turn around
Huh ok that's fast
they were dating till early 2020
And then he went to the military
Meet someone -> date (for a little bit I hope) -> 9 months -> kid
He really was speedrunning
Did they break up BC of him
She said this is the only ex that she doesn't think is awful
It was mainly cause they were not compatible
Oh alright
Maybe he'll be an okay father then
How old is he
Like the same age she is
so like 21
Also is he married to the mum? Does culture force people to do that in mongolia
he is not
no
A lot of the dads just disappear lmao
But it you're in a stable relatively long relationship and you get pregnant and keep it you usually get married earlier than you initially planned
does that make sense?
Lmao
Yeah I guess
Wait
My parents did that
My parents did too
I was born 8 months after my parents married
My mum was like
Lmaooo
"why did you think we got married”
when she told me she was pregnant w me during the wedding
My friend also told me about how she went to a family friend who is a shaman
and he told her "you're about to bring a husband home”
and she was like "no???”
 :face_with_open_mouth:  :face_with_open_mouth:  :face_with_open_mouth:  they know

Taipei is eh
Ok but most of my childhood memories that were good were in Nuremberg
Counting childhood as 0-12
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Down hill since 7

<Media omitted>

BANGER
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Allegedly good adult memories haha
I turned 18 right before covid
and a few days after I turned 18 my uncle passed away
Fun birthday present
Omg no
I meant
The COVID thing
Ironically
Sorry
I know you did dw
Still good adult memories tho? Even though stuck at home
London has been good  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  right?
London has been good
So was Scotland
I really liked the Scotland trip
What a vibe
Yeah
Yeah Scotland trip was actually impressively good
Nothing went horribly wrong
The weather was perfect
I know
I forgot who said this
Me
But someone asked
I asked and answered
whether we fought
Oh nvm
and i was like "uhh no??”
And they were like
"oh ppl usually fight when they go on trips”
It was only 3 days tho
4
How many hours
Oh yeah
Let me check my all inclusive and full encapsulating document
4am on the 14th of May
Until 1am on the 18th of May
71 hours
I had to use a calculator for that
Totally didn't need to
only 71??
Yeah
hmm
interesting
3 days but not full days
Right
I see
oh yeah
totally
cant even count now
Domestic abuse  :pensive_face: 
what am I even doing  :cowboy_hat_face: 
it was such a bad joke
but it was funny
Id argue that makes it a good joke
given that it was funny?
fair argument
<Media omitted>
Is that meant to be bad?
It's pretty cursive, if it's "bad" its just more artful
Yes
can you even read "periodic”
Uh yeah?
It says periodic
Holding a pen does not feel natural atm
Not a good sign
Eh breaks are fine

You need to taunt her so she actually gives you more work
Me dad doesn't like bones cracking
But I've gotten so in the habit
I need to contain myself

I kinda wanna read the whole version of this
But also not
I totally do
unrelated
but
i finally managed to crack that part of the foot below the toe
i am v satisfied
Did it hurt
I feel like
If you try too hard for too long to crack
It'll hurt
it was a relieving hurt?
does that make sense?
A little bit
I mean most cracks are like that
it did
What're you doing now did you finish your exercises
I was scrolling through tiktok and taking dance breaks
I did not finish
I got bored
Dance breaks
Pushing back to tomorrow
Probably
Is your meeting on Wednesday
No
Monday
Wait what did your supervisor give you on the day I left
Just the exercises?
yes
she actually didnt give me anything
she said she'd give me sth
Yeah didn't you already have those?
then like a few days ago
she gave me the exercises
Or you asked for them
i kinda did
How much tour stuff do utou have
Or can you have
I kinda wanna go on a Mish tour
I don't know much about UCL
And I wanna see this animated alter ego
What?
I'm so confused
You were talking about how your a different person when girlboss math or giving UCL tours
I wanna go on a UCL tour
Oh lmao
I could probably take most random shifts that pop up
Will you be giving tours In September  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Like there was one yesterday that I didn't take cause I realised Saulet would be here
probably
I'm kinda too lazy to apply though bc it's separate somehow  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
And also dk if I wanna commit to full day shifts
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Fair enough
I'll give tours throughout the year
Next year
and also in August
Girlboss
Did I tell you?
I'm volunteering for the same NT course that Jean is
She's with Ian Petrow
I'm with Cecilia Busuoic
Oh yeah you told me
Wait what
You're not with Ian petrow
I'm not
Even though it's the same class
That's devestating
I meant
A course
for high school students
ie helping high school kids
Ohhhh
Right you mentioned I think
Voulenteer girlboss
I'm taking the same NT module that Jean is
lmao
And stats  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Jean is too right
She is

Stats
Yay

Watching professional league of legends
With my friend
He's also a nerd
He's actually who got me into league like 6 years ago
nerd
We went for dinner
 :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: 
You didn't have to say it
Anyway

We had ramen for lunch

that sounds like good lunch
It was
And it was the restaurants 3 month anniversary so we got free green tea ice cream
And we're probably going boating later
Maybe not tho
It's very hot
And I'm tired still
Omg
Pog

Because I was gonna say and now I'll kill myself
But the typo ruined it

Another stroke of genius from Alexander Yule
mhm
not as good as what actually happened
My comedic prowess has transcended my own consciousness is the conclusion I have reached
ok

sorry

<Media omitted>
she looks like a cute kitten
but also a grumpy bunny
yk
I guess?
I'm seeing more of this one tbh
hm okay
<Media omitted>
Okay
I'm kinda seeing it
When I tell you I gasped
This bunny is so cute
I'm gonna lose it
Babie
babie indeed
I'm gonna cry
Wait
Do you think a build a Bear is a good gift
For Gaurav?
Ye
Stuffed animal and you can put a voice message
Awww
Voice message??
Yeah
That's so cute
Ok but then
how would that work
I make it then ship it
Right
Right
that's cute
Do you think the bear should just be my voice or should I put others, it's up to 20 seconds
probably just your voice
What are you gonna say
don't say bing chilling
bbbbbbb bing chilling
in the tune of ddddderek?
??

<Media omitted>
Awww
Peakaboo
peakaboo indeed
its so cute
someone's crying on my floor ??
i am confusion
and it's not a voice i recognise
they left
??
Oh no
<Media omitted>
i am gonna cry
babies
senior citizens*
But still
babies
Someone's already doing that
we can both be crying
True
also
i really dont understand the scale of the US
I cannot find anything
whenever you're away from your folsom house
Yeah too big
i have no idea what zoom i should be using
228 Waverly st is my house
Driving home rn
Oh ok
<Media omitted>
that is far alexander
Indeed
2 hours drive
hm
maybe not that far then?? 2 hrs is how long it takes to get to tuv province
I have no idea how to compare the size of the us to anything really
I mean Mongolia is pretty big too
it is
but like
that's different
How so
inside the city
aka ulaanbaatar
Like in terms of distance
everythings super close
but also not close without a car
but also close
but then when you leave ulaanbaatar
everything takes ages
???
that 2 hours doesnt feel that long
???
ie tuv aimag is technically the surrounding province so it's not "2 hrs” away from ulaanbaatar bc you can take a step at the border or whatever
but
tuv aimag feels close
What is tuv aimag
even though it isnt
tuv province
<Media omitted>
wrong screenshot
<Media omitted>
The only other thing on the map
Is 2 hours away
thats a zoomed in version
like going to tuv aimag is like less than a daytrip
so it feels close yk?
but its far
but its close bc its closer than anything else
does that make sense
Yeah living in London with no car probably messes with distance perception
yeah
i checked and my walk from home to the city centre is 54 mins according to google maps
I guess ¿
but it feels super close
like walking to ucl feels further than walking to the city centre
But the mountain road
 :face_with_open_mouth: 
you dont have to take the mountain road
you take the mountain road to get from the most bougee place in the city to where i live
Is your school in the bougee place
Bsu so fancy  :flag;_United_Kingdom: 
<Media omitted>
its near the airport
past the bougee place
that area is so weird
its somehow extremely expensive
yet extremely inconvenient
Okay I see what you mean about the handwriting
Lmao
and also the stuff there just isnt good
im not a fan lmao
like theres nothing there
no good grocery stores
weirdly expensive low quality things
its super empty
it seems like it could be an extremely fancy place
but its just not
they filmed a music video there once when my grandma and my cousin were there vibing
and they got asked to play a role in it
Seems like u have a lot of music videos around there
yeah
 :pensive_face: 
its in this place called "vivacity”
and there were a bunch of mvs filmed there
but i really dont like that place
the quality is bad
selection is bad
not a vibe
completely empty
nothing to do
And that makes for good music videos
https://youtu.be/_ijNXsOPWE8
1.27
then keep watching till my cousin pops up
Your cousin  :face_with_open_mouth:  :face_with_open_mouth: 
<Media omitted>
my sister just told me to buy this
with the glasses
Do they not have candy in ub?
not these
<Media omitted>
yes
Trip to American candy store then  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
this was ages ago i mean  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
now he's graduated stanford or sth
idk im not that in touch w my dad's side of the family
but also he's my favourite cousin
Subtle flex
big brother energy
Aww that's nice
Sane
Same
I'm gonna kms
lmaoo
made me laugh
was that you trying to say that you have big brother energy
Yeah
 :upside-down_face: 
he used to look after me when i was like 8 and he was 15
and he locked me in the bathroom w the lights off
Lmao what
Giga chad
as in
he couldnt lock it from the outside
so he just pulled the door
so i couldnt pull it open
Wow
15 year old putting in the effort to bully tiny German girl
lmao
I can respect
then i made toast for the both of us
as in
we didnt have a toaster
so i put butter in a pan and then put bread on ot
it
After being locked in the bathroom
Made 8 year old make food for him
Why is he your favourite
Did you get stockholmed
he was super fun to be around
he had his like flip phone
Oh nvm it's lit
and he'd make movies
of me standing there and then saying sth like "im gonna do a magic trick”
and then cut it
i leave the frame
continue playing
idk
i think he's just good w kids
Aww that's fun
and also when i was 11 i was supposed to be looking after my sister
briefly
but then i took my attention off her for a second
and she fell off the sofa and bumped her head
and my parents just yelled at me
Oh no
i ran to the bathroom to cry
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
he came and comforted me
Why are they giving 11 year old jurisdiction
i think i mightve been 12
Was nice to crying 11 year old what a king  :crown:  :crown: 
either 11 or 12 cause ik it was indra not emulen
lmao the bar is on the floor but he was genuinely fun to be around
when i was in 10th grade he let me rant about the incompetent english teacher (rip) and told me to just do my own thing
Wait the sexual assult teacher
and he took me to the littest playgrounds when i was 8 or sth near my grandma's house
no
just incompetent
Okay not sa but sus
not sus
just incompetent
Right
and bought me ice cream
then right before i was supposed to go to oxf i was talking to him about mafs and stuff
Aw
Ok that's nice
Mafs
and he was talking about how maths ppl at stanford he knows want to work at google
when i told him i didnt know what to do w it
bc i thought itd sound pretentious to say research when i hadnt started my undergrad
?????
Mish when interests
 :persevering_face:  :persevering_face:  :persevering_face: 
what
Wanting to do maths and research is cool  :double_exclamation_mark: 
but like
Same
Not at Stanford tho
i think its a little ahead of myself to say "i wanna do research” when i had no idea what uni maths would be like
and i still dont know what research is like 3 years later  :skull: 
Yeah but if you are really into maths I think the passion/ambition is cool
*were
Ok ok i'll stopp
It's fine
You can be interested in other things or you can take time to find what you're into
It's chill
Ok ok I'll stopp
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  sorry i dont mean to make every convo about this
thank you
It's ok I promise
and i have just been talking at you for the past hour  :woman_facepalming;_light_skin_tone: 
about my cousin
and mongolia
and my grandma
Being talked at is nice
You never finished this
oh i meant  "he told me about google when i said i didnt know what to do w maths”
Yeah good call, work for Google
can your dad confirm?
Yeah it's lit
mhm
great
Cool, will see you there
sounds good
you know
Do I?
the thing that i'm doing rn
about chaos
my supervisor was telling me it's what's used in weather prediction
ie thats why the forecast is always inaccurate
sensitivity to initial conditions
The weather uses chaos stuff
so i was like hey what if i become a weather person
That doesn't sound helpful for being actuate
Accurate
Yooooo that'd be sick
but that also requires
fluid mechanics
Oh no
so we'll see what comes out of fluid mechanics and how dreadful it is :D
All my homies hate fluids
have fun w fluids next year
i feel like
If you hated the class but did well on the test does that redeemed it?
you might ask me
something related to fluids
and i will not be able to answer
in a similar manner to newtonian
not really
maybe a little
You said useful things when I asked you about Newtonian
Thanks
<Media omitted>
Haha
basic python skills and not totally unfamiliar w sql? good combo if u ask me lmao
Is this for weather
Huh
shell meteorologist
shell as in the company
i am v tired
i mean
it in a sarcastic "i totally fit the job desc” way
Yeah!! You know python
You can learn sql
Whatever that is
it's excel but more command-y
less app-y
Can't wait to see you on TV pointing a stick at things
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
lmaoo
Was this so I didn't think you meant the object
idk
i dont think so
Doesn't matter, point is you can do a bunch of stuff with a maths degree
But more so
You can do a bunch of stuff with your big brain
Do
So
Bing chilling  :soft_ice_cream:  :cold_face:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
thank you
Nws
i feel like i'm being super needy recently lmao mainly about my existential crisis
omg

if i live to 80 then yes
????
You're making things up now lmao
I'm bringing it up at forcefully supporting you more than anything
So dtiydk
this was a sarcastic quirky statement
 :loudly_crying_face:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

lmaoo
Have you seen Gaurav recently
he was at brunch
and left 4 mins after i came
to do fca reading
why?
Nothing much
Wilfred has left me on sent for 3 days
I'm emotionally stricken
The Nutford group chat is now 2022 alumni  :loudly_crying_face: 
oh no
maybe he just forgot to reply?
you seem super special to him and theres probably a lot going on in india
by seem i mean he actually said "alexander yule is special”
Hahaha
This was a sarcastic emotionally stricken
i knowp
indeed
But I need to be on good terms to get my room
i ran into jean on the streets
yes
And I'm kinda interested in how India is going
i am too
lmao
Oh no  :sad_but_relieved_face:  hope you two are alright
lmaoo
jean saw me and ran towards me without any regard for the cars on the street
which tbf was almost empty
but still
Awww
endangering herself smh
Jean is such a Mish fangirl
i also think gaurav may be annoyed w me
Why's that
she said "i love you mish” as we were leaving so i believe you
oh the matias victoria secret incident
???
saulet asked me my bra size again
Lmao what
She forgot?
then the convo we had on the bus came up again
i didnt tell her that time
Or you never told her
Oh right
and then i was like oh yk this came up in convo w gaurav and alex
and i told her about the convo
and then i remembered the matias incident
and i told her about that
then later on she brought it up w gaurav
and he was like
why would you tell her that
im never gonna tell u anything ever again
He said that
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
Idk doesn't seem that bad a thing to tell Saulet but I guess maybe you should've
we kinda brushed over it after but you know how he has things in the back of his mind
Mhmm
idk
Then again it doesn't feel like he's that much closer to us than to Saulet so idk why it's a big deal
Especially enough to warrant this
When did this happen
at spitalfields
ie an hour before we saw the prof at the bus station
probably because he doesnt want saulets opinion of matias to fall lower than it already is
Okay that's a fair point
Oh also
What brought on the boyemployee Revolution
oh lmaoo
it started w noah
she was like
And I was scared to ask out of fear of being out ranked
But are the girlies still titled it's just the boys
Because that's violent misandry
<Media omitted>
Haven't you asked about the air mattress before
what
Also "sorry I was almost hit by a car" lmaooo
Like not understood how to inflate it, I feel like we ran into this problem already
did we
I think you and Gaurav were struggling together
we were
but we closed the big hole
then never filled through the small holep
and left the small hole open
ie thats why it was uncomfy when i woke up
the air was slowly being lwt out
Did we? I'm pretty sure it was empty when you woke up because the mattress sucks
Now that Nutford is over I don't need to worry about my mattress reputation
no
it was def open
I feel like maybe I shouldn't say things like "my mattress reputation"
Ok
taylor swift
Yes Taylor swift Indeed
"shes better known for the things that she does on the mattress”
I had false God in my head for some reason
I love false gos
god
Even though I haven't listened to it since we did our lyrics analysis
<Media omitted>

<Media omitted>
lmao
thats actually kinda cool
theres probably a tube below me
w ppl in it
That's crazy
Id say see if you can hear it
But bakerloo and Victoria are low lines
If you were by the circle line then maybe
and im listening to t swift
That's only a few feet below ground at some points
but girls trip along circle line?
Well it's above ground for a portion so we can hear it then
And we kinda do girls trips along the circle line whenever we walk on marylebone road
oh ok
<Media omitted>
huh
Marylebone
yea idg why americans get jurisdiction
I'm going to petition Google to change the pronunciation tab to "British pronunciation" and "wrong pronunciation"

 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
i thought this was you mocking me
It was
the photo?
But in a nicer way than normal, trust
ok
This is me boybossing
Doing nothing
indeed
oh yeah
whats going on w quantum computing
Uh
Nothing
Since I've been too lazy
you are so relatable
I think they met on Wednesday
everyone always asks me about my project
Idk
Yeah but that's because you're doing everything your supervisor is giving you
eh
kinda
Bruh  :skull: 
This isn't a kinda situation you either did or didn't
The only thing that adds complexity is that you asked for more work than the default amount
i kinda told her im reading a textbook
which im fairly confident
ill finish by tomorrow
...
Are you reading a textbook
funky indeed
Groovy*
i started a while ago
also groovy
Why did you not say
I was all like what are you doing and you're all like nothing just chilling _and also reading a textbook for funsies_
the first chapter lmao
i am like 5 pages in
out of 30
Oh ok lmao
but most of it is stuff i alr know
Oh actually
Same
For the quantum textbook
I'm 5 pages in
And it's all normal computing so far
Lmaoooo
5 pages in besties
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
I really should do the quantum thing tho
I have been complaining I have nothing to do
For the past 5 days
yeah
Even though I totally do have a thing to do
probably
i cant tell you anything
i am also doing nothing
:D
:DDD
What're you doing now tho
LaTeXing I think
Have fun with your latex  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
danke
<Media omitted>
(i have not latexed yet)
i redid the exercises lmao
Fancy cursive  :star-struck: 
danke
Do you have them down
Are you slaying them
not the last bit just yet
taking a break by latexing
Ugh what a math Queen "I'm taking a break from math with more math"
Maths* can't let this country get a grip on me
lmaooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
what are you gonna do today
Idk
I'm back in the vale do maybe we friends in the evening

Mhmm
smh so cool
I use cool slang like that
That's me
<Media omitted>
ayayay
What does that sound like
I'm assuming it's a yoy substitute
<Media omitted>
That was a very unexcited ayayaya
idk how to explain it
if my sister does something cute im like ayayaya (excited)
if my sister makes a mess im like
Nono I heard it and I understand now
But
ayayaya (disapproving)
I feel like your demonstration could have used a little more pizazz
have you gotten to this episode yet
The one where Gina is like my whole life is pizzazz?
Or something like that
Yeah
Also have u just been grinding in the library for 3 hours
What a slat
Slay
I should totally go to the library to work
i have been in the library for 3 hours
<Media omitted>
the one where gina directs the video
and replaces holt

<Media omitted>
i have never heard of pizazz outside of b99 so this was exciting
<Media omitted>
Is that jiguang yu  :exclamation_question_mark: 
Oh yeah
Really never?
lmaoo
It's not that uncommon a word
never
<Media omitted>
Getting executed tomorrow

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
kinda dont want that to happen now
floof seems fun
Only kinda don't want me to get executed wow ok
mhm
ok
Aha, that would have warranted crying emojis out of old Mish
building up immunity to gaslighting
You're welcome  :relieved_face: 
technically not gaslighting
i'm sorry, the old mish cant come to the phone rn,. why? cause shes dead
old mish being mish from a week ago
 :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
I think new Mish is just tired and too fed up to deal with my dumb bits
But this is still progress
i am kinda tired
been sitting in the sc for a while now
not that fed up yet
Oh student centre
Why there
i brought brownies
Saulet likes it bc she'll see friends and waste time
and its empty now
 :relieved_face:  proof
Oh that's cool
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
i have eaten way too much
its so fudgy
Is this Tesco brownie
Those are very fudgy indeed
sainsbury
I've commented on this before but I really like the millionaire bites
Oh
sainsbury is somehow even fudgier
Doesn't matter they all have them
i know  :relieved_face: 
<Media omitted>
lmaooo
"get naked"
i guess its ok
but not necessary indeed i agree
<Media omitted>
But water just gets everywhere
The mat is new
But the next time someone takes a shower it will be drenched
you need a door though  :loudly_crying_face: 
I know  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i also feel like it would get cold in the winter if theres no door
but then again
you live in "the vale"#
ok almost done w it
but i think im gonna go back home 4 dinner
feeling #notgood
also loud bitches have arrived
oh no
#sad
I was on the b99 memes subreddit
and they're obsessed with the one line where holt says "you're not cheddar, you're just some common bitch"
and that is what I'll think of anytime someone uses the word bitch from now on
and I'll think of ducks anytime someone uncorks a bottle of wine  :upside-down_face: 
OH
someone is giving away a piano 20 minutes from here
so I might get a piano in my house :D
thats in season 5 episode 4
the one that you promised to watch w me :)
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
right
:)
exciting
omg
I'm glad you got that
would have sounded rather insane otherwise
of course
who do you think i am
Mish?
oh no
is this not Mish
<Media omitted>
I'm sorry I swear I'm not gaslighting her or anyone
give it to ducks :D
pidgeons*
jk trash it
theres still one left
mayhaps
<Media omitted>
the machine is broken
not that the cafe is open rn
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
but i went in a while ago
good thing we got in there before it immediately broke lol
mhm
and got approached by christians
good times
i have the worst hiccup ive had in a while
and had korean food which by the way is mostly chinese
oh do you have an anti hiccup method
no
like the traditional western one is pat your head while rubbing your stomache
really? never
or try to drink water while standing on your head
no method has ever worked
Oh I have a good one
You know how you're hiccuping
Just
Stop that
<Media omitted>
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  works every time
Fun and exciting
wow thanks
Oh yeah you said you're working photo booth?
What does that mean
Photography slay
not photo booth
just making sure the graduates get in queue
and their names match their picture
ie theyre gonna be in line for grad pics
i think
lmao
Is that inside?
You'll have to be standing tho
That was your complaint last time right
not the main one
I remember you were salty at the people with better jobs  :grinning_face_with_sweat:  :cowboy_hat_face: 
stressing about ppl going in thw wrong place and parents
registration is the best
youre just sitting there doing nothing
Nice nice
For the pictures
It can't be that hard
no for auditorium
pictures should be chill
im happy about pictures
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  no jiguang yu either  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  probably
<Media omitted>

i guess you could say he didnt have pork
uh
I don't know who good ahmed is
the nice receptionist
oh right
yeah
nutford had onion and cheese bakes?
they're getting fancy my goodness
back in my day if you wanted one of those you'd have to steal it from greggs
theyve had them before
during the term
also you ignored my bad and cheesy joke  :loudly_crying_face: 
I get what you're going for but porking with the cafeteria staff has another meaning
is this how you feel always
haha cheesy
^ that was intentional btw
well done
moving pianos is hard
but at least you're moving it :D

I just talked to Saulet

good job
I am boredom
This is actually a typo
I was typing bored
But I need to deal w this last bit
which is turning out to b lowkey annoying
You would type this tho
I would definitely
My fingers knowing me better than I know me lmao
 :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
Last bit of what
Latex?
not latex
actually figuring it out
its more annoying than i expected
But I'm sure I can do it
Oh right and that's annoying
But it's annoying
Yes
If your meeting tomorrow?
Is
Yes
Last minute mess  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Diamonds are made under pressure  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
lmao
danke
dont think this proof will be a diamond but  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Well actually they're made under pressure so
Would you say you're feeling the pressure?
mayhaps
not too much
Huh
but i am lowkey tired but im not gonna sleep till its done
We need more pressure then
When is your meeting tomorrow
And are you gonna demand loads and loads of work
11am
yes
im gonna ask for like 3 papers
Slay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ok
What sort of response is ok  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
But if you speed run papers now will you have enough papers to last you
probably
i mean
theres a lot of papers out there right
Right but isn't your project following a set of papers
kind of
but the set can change
she was like
im super flexible
if you find this more interesting than that then we can do this bla bla
sorry
Oh cool so infinite papers
Find your own papers why not
Read a textbook while you're at it
 :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:

slay
nobody plays the piano at nutford anymore :(
:(((
realised im dumb
lmao
i thought the middle third was supposed to be removed
turns out its the middle half
Oh my god
The middle half  :person_facepalming:  :person_facepalming: 
I get the middle half and third confused all the time
Classic misstep
alex  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mosh  :loudly_crying_face: 
yoy
i was trying to prove sth completely different
Ok you wanna explain what you meant
all along
ok
Like for the audience
I already know
so basically
Ofc
i am supposed to prove that if you take an infinite number of iterates of a function, then the set of points that dont eventually become fixed form a cantor set
and a classic cantor set is one
where you keep removing the middle interval
open middle i should say
Okay
so if you have an interval [0,1] after the first one
you get
[0, 1/3] U [2/3, 1]
because you removed (1/3, 2/3)
Ohhh I see
How do you decide on 1/3 being the interval
and then you remove the middle third of [0, 1/3] and [2/3]
The size that is
Mhmm
thats the classic example
Right ok
the most simple one
because its the easiest one where all the intervals are the same
And are the inputs of the functions that don't get fixed intervals?
That make cantor sets?
uhh only for the function that im looking at
Epic function
the cantor set itself is a silly quirky thing w various properties that im unaware of
so my function f is defined on [0,1] mapped to [0,1]
Okay
and i need to show that all the points that are not eventually fixed
so eventually f^(k+1)=f^(k)(x)
form a set thats similar to the cantor set
Similar to the cantor set?
ie if you keep removing infinite middle bits
and i assumed that that meant
keep removing infinite thirds
but i had a closer look at the function
turns out you remove the middle half
How does that work tho?
so you end up with 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 length intervals
Huh
That's strange
or you could imagine it as
Then the side domains aren't the same
As the inner one
1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4
Right
Ohhhh
and removing the middle 2
That makes sense
yeah
i did not realise i had to do that
cause in the previous part i showed that in order for a point not to be eventually periodic
And now that you did
Easy moneyM
Money?*
i hope so
it should go easier
Good luck  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
thank you  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
yep
done
got the gist
Well done!
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: thank u :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sleep time now?
should be
i'll get up early tomorrow
i need to do laundry before showering
so laundry early
All before breakfast
 :loudly_crying_face: 
yes
That's too much
You can do laundry, the shower while it's running
Then put it in dryer then breakfast while drying
Light work
Only need to be up at 830 that way
Still get 7 hours
Agreed!!!
i will not be in and out of the shower in 25 mins
up and down the stairs
25 minute?? That's a long time
Or not thattt long
But long enough
Okay then you can do 30 minute breakfast
it includes 5 mins of me just cleaning the shower before
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
idk ill manage somehow#
alarm at 7am bestie
Whatttt
That's unnecessary
alarm at 7 doesnt mean wake up at 7
lmao
Wake up at 8, do laundry then speedrun breakfast
Then shower while drying
Bing chilling
Wait no
Do all that at 830
hmm
ill see
but i need to latex tomorrow
i got the gist
but i need to lay it out nicely
Your big brain needs sleep energy to talk to supervisor
Do you always latex it
Is paper not good enough
<Media omitted>
paper is not good enough for my supervisor
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
as it should be  :relieved_face: 
paper rings  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  indeed
Yooy
i am v tired
Maybe sleeping
That's what people do when they're tried
Tired
mhm
 :curly_loop:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
That's a rope
??
Why a rope?
are you saying
Tried instead of tired
youre killing urself?
Yes
Wait
When people are being tried
That's also kinda tired
Nvm
Rope revoked
lmao
right
Did you have to think for two minutes to conclude that "right" is the correct thing to say here
After a lmao
i was washing my face
and i often type very absent mindedly
Oh wow not even trying in conversation anymore :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
too tired
Ok fair enough
but also i generally type absent mindedly if im doing sth
or im with someone
If I text you and it's before 9am CA time all my texts are at like 35% brain capacity
But I'll do that
i am not a multitasker
Like the whole conversation this morning
Being able to text while talking to someone is multitasking
a lot of your texts are before 9am CA time
But did you know you can't actually multitask
Your brain can just switch between tasks quickly
right
literally most of our convo today was before 9am ca time
Yeah a lot of my texts are at 35%
Okay
9am ca time is 5pm uk time
It starts at 35%
Then it increases gradually
yeah that makes more sense
you will also be able to tell when i am replying while half asleep
like the "interesting”
<Media omitted>
to your picture
Very good at being mostly asleep for texting
Oh yeah I kinda figured
my message went to seen as soon as i sent it
but you did not reply
and were online the whole time
lmao
so i was like
probably fell asleep or sth
Yeah asleep with the phone in my hand  :upside-down_face: 
ok realised this sounds a bit insane  :smiling_face_with_halo:  i promise im not insane
how are you still not used to the time diff though  :loudly_crying_face: 
going backwards is usually ok
ie going west
???? This isn't insane
That's a logical conclusion
I'm mostly accustomed
I'd wake up to check my phone when I was sleeping
mhm
5.32am
yooy
Okay maybe not totally
mhm
There's just a piano in my house
This is sick
there is
that is sick indeed
learn t swizzle  :pleading_face:  ?
Not sure there's many good t swizzle songs for piano
But I'll look
wildest dreams?
<Media omitted>
oh no
library trip??
or yk
ink trip
printer trip
idk
Ink is expensive  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I think library trip proby
i dont understand
i hate the fact that ink is expensive
Yeah
They sell printers at a loss I think
Allegedly
yeah ive heard this
Then sell ink that takes like 12 c to produce for 20£
yeah
yooy
ok
actual sleep time
Actual sleep time  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
mhm
good night  :white_heart: 
have fun today
Goodnight  :white_heart:  sleep well
Not much left in today
But I got a piano so it's a win
didnt you say you were gonna meet friends in the evening
or sth
its a huge win
Massive dub  :cowboy_hat_face: 
i dont understand
but okay
good night
i am v tired
Ok
Goodnight
 :white_heart: 
 :white_heart: 
The audacity of this child
Johnny is like why did you get a piano when you already have a keyboard, because with the keyboard you can just play by yourself but with the piano everyone has to hear you play
First of all
The keyboard is like 40 dollars and has no key sensitivity, no pedals, and sounds bad
Second of all
This child has picked the 3 loudest instruments he could find
Drums, trumpet, and symbols
And either practices them in his room, right next to mine
Or outside
Also next to my room
The piano is as far from his room as possible
I can't believe this
smh
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yooy
smh
younger siblings am i right
my 7am plan did not go as i wanted it to

 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i was chilling
How often do you try and enter my room
ive tried 3 times so far
2/3 successful
And also what are they going with my room, locking and unlocking it
Strange people
i tried again today bc i was passing by
for laundry
and i remembered
they're checking the hook things
so they probably wouldve unlocked it
so i was checking if they locked it back
<Media omitted>
like these things
Yeah yeah ik the hook things
they did not
Nice
How's my room doing
Empty  :loudly_crying_face: 
empty indeed  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i can go in again lmao

^ my laundry plan has also not gone to plan
That would be very exciting
Oh right lmao
indeed
How was your meeting
it was ok
She gave me another example
Just one?
which she said is gonna be harder to go through
And then I asked for more
So she said she will send me more
Well
it actually does seem harder
more papers and exercises :D
We know how good she is at responding to emails so make sure you remind her
Yes
:::DDD
:D
made another draft you wont see  :relieved_face:  (at least not in the not far far far away future)
 :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face:  why do you taunt me so
One day
 :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Actually
Okay
If you die first then you can show me before you die because you'll be too busy being dead to be embarrassed
And if I die first then it's like a dying wish sort of situation
before i die??
And you can't deny me that
lmao
Like on your deathbed
rosa situation
Or I guess put it in your will
"ive only said i love you to three people”
So after your dead
"alexander yule will have access to my tiktok account”
Yes
Oh I thought when Charles handcuffed Jake and said it's the hardest thing I've had to do and I pulled the plug on 3 of my grandparents
And Jake was like how are you always in charge of that
Lmaoooo
That was really funny
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

and im in the laundry room so  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Oh that was meant to be sarcastic
That's a little embarrassing I'm not gonna lie
For you that is, just wanted that to be clear
not as embarrassing at the tiktoks
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  why do you do this to me
haha
<Media omitted>

tf you mean aw, that's a demon m gremlin photo
The only justification for "aw" is if it's in the context of "aw yeah we found a gremlin these sell for a lot on the black market"
you're like noah
if noah was self deprecating
lmao
I am not self deprecating
But when I take a picture in the dark with flash while I'm half asleep

Babies

Babies  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
My heart is so full
Awww

Yes

Okay  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :cowboy_hat_face: 
Still with Jean and Beatrice?
No
Just came back from dinner
Beatrice is on a train back
Am alone in my room
 :sad_but_relieved_face: 
How's Jean
Studying for exams?
Super duper stressed
No project
She said that she would do exactly an hour of the project
and then do analysis 3
worst module ever
 :smiling_face_with_tear: 
I'm gonna go die bc of analysis 3  :upside-down_face:  worst module ever
Ugh that's not true
Ok maybe not worst module ever
in terms of content
Your already died because of analysis 3 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
But worst module in terms of exam
Oh yeah how stupid of me to forget
ok

When your in Mongolia the roles will be reversed as far as time zones so you can be the one to ruin my plans and keep me up at strange times
Goodnight!  :white_heart: 
mhm will definitely do
good night  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
also
i dont think 1am is a strange time for me to be awake
i had a dream
Relax mlk
wait
Waiting
now i need to think
did you tell me this story inside the dream or did this actually happen
Nah don't think
Just say
It's funnier that way
you said that there was this girl who is now graduating ucl this guy wanted to date
a guy you knew from back home
and he asked her out on a date
and then asked his brothers to be waiters or sth
and now she's a comp sci girlie
and i was like oo who is she
and you showed me the ig
and i knew her
had a dream that i was out w her
I didn't say that
i now realise this
i am only 20% awake
btw shes an actual person at ucl
she crochets and is bisexual and comp sci
all the boxes
Oh this is a dream about someone else
Oh wow
Nice
Out with her?!
????
idk whether it was a hang out or a date but i kinda knew her and i was thinking
"what a coincidence”
idk
i am barely awake
I feel like you find yourself in these, oh I know this person already conincidences a lot
lmao
oh
and she does rock climbing
yooy
So it's believable
Wow another box
and she's in a band
Like a cool band or a cringe one
i cant tell
Most bands are cool
So unless it's a cringe one
It's probably cool
mhm
i think i found out about her existence
through science library guy
i think theyre either besties or dating
? The loud one with foot fungus
nooo
And how do you know all this? Other than usual Mish behaviour
the guy who i once saw in the scilib, thought he was kinda attractive, went to graduation, found out he was playing there as part of his band thing, someone told me theyre the ucl live music soc and you can figure out the rest
someone asked on uclove once
Right that
and then i found his name and realised i knew of him cause he always comments on uclove
As you do
And is she in the same band as this guy
i promise im not insane :)
no
How do you know all this info then
And does Saulet know about this individual
saulet knows about sci lib guy
ive shown her this girl once
i dont think she remembers
And you know all her hobbies, sexuality, major, presumably address and social security number
Because?
hobbies & major are all in her instagram bio + she has the pride flag emoji in her bio
i dont know address or social security no :)
Oh alright fair enough  :grinning_face_with_sweat:  :grinning_face_with_sweat: 
Get on that then, can't have the spreadsheet having holes
her name is alex
Ong?!
ong indeed
That's sick
Wait no
I can't become Alex #2
I can and will cry
lmaoo
you will not become alex #2
Ok  :white_heart:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: 
ok*
and thats not just cause i dont know her and she's graduating now and i'm never  gonna see her and even if i did i would not make a move
promise
Ah good! I was thinking it might be for that reason! But this message has reassured me otherwise!!
 :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
I feel like my head is too oval shaped without my hair obscuring parts
it seems fine to me
Hold on
Oh
You haven't shared your statement with me, email is alexander@yule.org whenever you get the chance
Cool thanks
no
That's a weird way to spell "okay will send soon" but whatever
<Media omitted>
Thanks
just saw this on twitter
no problem
ok
i think you're joking
but also
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I think you're right
ok
thanks
Nws m-dawg
are you gonna sleep
Maybe
Well yes
Eventually
mhm
i think i might sleep
my brain is not functioning
Ok
Goodnight again
good night
again
or for you
first time?
idk
I've slept before
A few times
sorry, assumed you just don't sleep
<Media omitted>
you look more oval than previously
not too ovally
 :smiling_face_with_tear: 
it's fine
<Media omitted>
Will just permanently look down on people
it does
not permanently
hair grows you know
Until then
You're kinda giving little sister energy
Get it, looking down on you
My comedic genius knows no bounds
Ok goodnight again
you already do that
Does that count as time 3
Not true
Except for the height thing
Oh were you initially referring to the height thing
i mostly meant the height thing because you dont look down on me often
but i meant both
mayhaps
When do I metaphorically look down on you
Ok goodnight, I'll edit your paper tomorrow morning
mostly meant whenever you're making fun of me
goodnight, no
omg
No
I was bored so I looked at Anand's linkedin
He's going on a year abroad next year
rip opportunity to make another math bestie
also i had another dream#
do you wanna hear about it
Yes please
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ok
Idk what was going on but
for some reason we moved to some other intercollegiate hall
Inferior hall but ok
but that was only temporary
and I was bunking with these two ppl
one girl who was rly cool and i got along w well
she was studying psychology
she kinda looked like triti's friend from jean's bday
do you remember
Uh vaguely
ok
I remember there being a friend don't remember what she looks like
But ok
but anyways the other guy was super quiet and i didnt talk to him but irrelevant
you and saulet were in some other room i remember
and then we were hanging out
and we were like hey we should do a bonfire night w  marshmallows
and i was like yeah omg
Wait was this my idea
yes
Because of course dream Alex is slaying
Ok continue
and i was trying to text the girl asking her to come
but i accidentally pressed on yixin's user instead
and he replied instantly being like
Oh no
"thanks for the invite! ill come along" or sth
like that
and i was like oh no
and you and saulet were like
well what can you do now#
Nothing  :person_shrugging: 
and i was like "i can tell him i texted the wrong person"
You wouldn't
and you (alex) were like "no you cant thats mean"
and i was like
Dream Mish is a Giga chad
"yes i can"
so i did
Omg
Both of those things are out of character
But good for you
what is out of character
Me saying that's mean and you actually doing it
lmao
but then i woke up
i also remember walking down a completely dark street
like so dark that i had to turn on my phone flashlight
After waking up?
presumably to get marshmallows
no during the dream
idk how that was related exactly
Mhmm ok
but that was it
ok yay
Was this dream from when you went back to sleep
yes
Right
left
Hilarious
Have you considered a career in comedy
i have actually
there's a game show in mongolia
where two comedians are on the panel
and you get 90 secs to tell a story
and if at least one of them laughs
you get money
 :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
and then you keep going on and the amount of money keeps increasing
or you can choose to stop
i thought that would be fun
Wow, meteorologist and Comedy show host
What can't she do
analysis 3
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
you know when i was half asleep i was texting jean
and jean sent me a message that just said "Analysis 3"
and i told her to give me a trigger warning next time
Why would she do that :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaooo
she was talking about how she needs to prepare for it
and
texting
in a style
similar to this
so "Analysis 3"
was one text
Okay
Deveststing
What are we supposed to make from these dreams
i dont know
as saulet says
"dreams reveal your desires and fears"
so idk what to make of this
Mhmm
i def desire the marshmallow bonfire thing
I'm gonna go with you want marshmallows that feels safe
dream alex is such a g for suggesting that
I know right
honestly what is going on w dream alex
Tiktok Alex < WhatsApp alex < discord Alex<<<< dream alex
getting hot girls, pointing a foot gun at me,  suggesting marshmallow nights
Getting hot girls stolen  :unamused_face: 
i never stole said hot girl
i said i was jealous
You totally wanted to tho
let a girl feel her emotions  :loudly_crying_face: 
Probably would if you could, dream Alex is just too cool  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging: 
lmaoo
value our friendship too much for that
trust
Awe okay  :growing_heart: 
I'll still brief future girlfriends, but I'll be less worried
and also am overall just a decent human being  :relieved_face: 
lmaoo
oh yeah
i saw a tiktok a while ago
it was like "i am his girl bsf. if you date him you dont need to worry about me wanting him but you just need to worry about me potentially wanting you" and i was like
dream mish relates
Hahaha
ok
oh did i mention
gaurav and i are going 2 pride
No
ava max is headlining??
tbh am more excited for girli but she's a smaller artist so nobody knows her
Ava max!!! That's my favourite person named Ava or max;!
lmaoo
Can you not explain who these people are please thank you  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Now***
ava max is the girl who sings sweet but a psycho
<Media omitted>
this one
Oh that one, I know that song
couldve sent this message earlier
so i didnt have to demonstrate
girli is a bisexual uk artist
Oh wow if I pretend to not know songs I get singing clips
i really like her songs
What's her most popular song
uhh probably more than a friend
Oh wow I haven't heard of that before  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
or friday night big screen
Oh wow I haven't heard of that before  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
If only there was some way to listen to a clip of it, but like, not the official song  :exclamation_question_mark: 
my god
Mhmm what's up
that was a bad joke
But still incredibly funny
I know I get that a lot
mhm
i waa trying to find more girli songs
<Media omitted>
this is so good
such a banger
Mhmm
I'll give it a listen at some point
yk she had a concert in london
on the 17th of nov
2021
i was thinking of going
so i could say id gone to a concert before my 20s
Oh why didn't you
Haha
i was v tired at around that time
and i wouldve had to go alone
Right
 :pensive_face: 
bc 1) she's not that big 2) i didnt want to be like "lets go to this niche queer artist's concert"
Yeah fair enough
What have you done today
what are you doing today
wow we're so in sync
Ha beat you to it
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
about to send the email w the research thing
 :unamused_face:

Haha all my homies love dance breaks

Well done
Thank you
Has your supervisor sent you papers yet

Ah
What's it like to be wrong? Can't relate
should be asking you
Good come back!!!!! Got me there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry that was rude
yeah that was a bit too much
but it's ok
<Media omitted>
Remember how I said that I remember random psych facts from taking the class
yeah
Well turns out I remember random, *wrong* psych facts
fair enough
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Still, 5-20 minutes for 9 hours of sleep (less in your case lmao) is still less than you'd imagine
Actually the same amount as you'd imagine, because your dreams are the imagioning
Was the joke made funnier after I explained it
I was told it works that way
my dreams are the what
Like you imagine your dreams
By definition
So it is as long as you would imagine
ah
Because your dreams last as long as you're imagining
whoever told you was wrong i think mayhaps
right
Might be onto something
I'm going to build a Bear workshop
Idk what Im gonna say into it tho
at dinner
so i cannot give any recommendations
i dont think i can give recommendations either way though
dinner or not
Can I call u for a bit
Then dinner
<Media omitted>
i am at dinner

by the time
What a homie right
you texted me
i _know_
Yeah yeah nws

my floor has somehow turned into its worst state ever
in like 4 days
since i last vacuumed
i like physically cannot stand it
You said it was good?
it was good
but somehow its gotten awful
within the last idk
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
fun
<Media omitted>
they are listening
Lmao
also
you should probably text saulet
she was like
he ignored my message about his hair
 :pensive_face: 
oh just found emojis
there were actually 6 not 5
lmao
 :musical_notes:  :bouquet: 
Go on
were the other 2
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Very cute
it was cute
anyways
i am gonna sleep
good night  :white_heart:  talk to you tomorrow
or today technically my time
but tomorrow your time?
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
A good morning is more appropriate here but it's the sentiment
As long as you wake up after 7:59 which I'm assuming is the case
Omg on the Facebook too, I thought it was from a show you're watching
Did it get bad in the 3 hours between you telling me it was good and vacuumed and this message
Not Alabama  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
<Media omitted>
We were walking on some mossy rocks in a cave by the beach and when the word mossy floated into my mind I thought of the wonderful nickname I got for you
sugar mama was stuck in my head all of today
or just a bit of it
actually didnt happen
yes
wow
good morning
lmao
good morning
:)
chihend chin "chto nado?” baiyaa bi sugar mama
Probably
i am
but anyways
i did not have a drea
m
Boring
bit disappointing if you ask me
Beach was fun!
what did you do
idk what ppl do on the beach
I dug a hole
Then I walked through a cave like thing
Then we dammed a stream just because
Then we played spike ball
Then we dug another hole
Then we swam around a bit
The waves were fun and the water was very cold
Then we got pizza
It was lit
cold??
also
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
what is it with digging holes  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's fun  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
ayayaya
that does sound good
mhm
Why are you awake
i dont know
Okay
We're on the same day now  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
i was on the phone for 5 hours last night
we are
literallt
With who
15 mins after you hung up
saulet called me
Hahah righr
then while i was on the phone w saulet my friend called me
So popular omg
^ she was just bored at work lmao
she works at a convenience store
and had to go there at 6am
ie leave at 6am
the shift doesnt start till like 7am
 :skull: 
I have a dentist appointment at 8
Idk why it's booked for 8
I don't wanna wake up then
but then you wont dread the rest of your day
right?!
I understand I'm complaining to someone currently awake at 8
Dentist isn't that bad
lmao
i stand by this
dentist isnt bad because of potential pain. it is bad bc of the potential judgment
judgement
Oh yeah I'm gonna be judged so hard
I have not been flossing
And I've been looking at my teeth
main point of judgement here
They are not looking very prestige
Oh I'm at a new adult dentist now
I think I mentioned
yeah you did
Im a little bit nervous he's gonna be like "you're an adult you need to be responsible  :enraged_face:  :enraged_face:  :enraged_face: "
I doubt he will
But I'm scared nonetheless
 :loudly_crying_face: 
probably wont
Ah, feeling reassured now
sorry
mongolian dentists would totally say that
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
It feels like people are just mean to you in Mongolia
uhh
maybe? it's not that bad lmao
what else are you doing tomorrow
Maybe people are just mean to you generally  :person_shrugging: 
Not me of
Ofc
Idk, probably reading a 60 page paper about quantum blockchains
hmmm?? idk about that  :loudly_crying_face: 
Whatever that is
fun
exciting
quantum blockchains
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  sorry
its ok
<Media omitted>
what is even going on w my sister  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why is she spamming you lmaoo
i an so happy  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
She even turned off auto caps to be like her cool big sister
Very cute
this made me try to think of an example of you being mean to me, i remembered yesterday then i remembered telling you about crystal and yooy that was genuinely such a thing
ie crystal
 :pleading_face:  :pleading_face: 
she would never admit it though lmao
she would say something like
"everyone does that on roblox it has nothing to do w you”
I wasn't mean to you then
Oh I was meaning to ask
you were not
How much teasing is appropriate about this
Because I promised I wouldn't and I'll stick to that
but i am going through my interactions chronologically
But sometimes my fyp knows too much
is it one of those tiktoks that are like "therapy isnt enough i need to fight the girl that i had a homoerotic friendship with that ended abruptly and left me devastated”
i get tons of those
???????
No???
okay
just asking
Ok, we need to test the waters so let me know if this makes you die of embarrassment
ok
Embarazzment*
<Media omitted>
no
as in
does not make me die of embarrassment
Ok
Oh Daniel asked me what music I listen to today on the car ride back from the beach
yeah
And I admitted to t-swizzle
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
And then I played some and he said it wasn't bad  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
what did you play??
cruel summer?
The good songs from lover
paper rings
london boy
i think he knows
Paper rings, cruel summer, London boy, I think he knows
Omg
Stop typeing them first  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
but also
sorry
but it was extremely sappy
and cute
yooy
I know right
also i didnt know about my bisexuality until like after it was over lmao
because i was like
i dont think youre supposed to feel this devastated and jealous
haha maybe this wasnt just bestie behaviour?
and then i was like oh no this was not just bestie behaviour
Mishhhh
My heart can't take this
my heart could not take it either lmao
Was she Alex at any point during this?
no
Wait you were in denial that calculating distances for hearts and making fan edits of each other and having personal emojis wasn't "bestie" behaviour
mind you we had a wedding date already and i still didnt know  :loudly_crying_face: 
LMAO
My heart is going to explode
so we took a buzzfeed quiz
separately
it was like
"pick some stuff we'll tell you an important date in the future”
we both got the same date
so we naturally concluded it was gonna be when we got married
That's so adorable  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  I cannot
and i still thought this was bestie behaviour
Right but like bestie married
Lmaooo
Wait okay, jealous?
after we stopped talking
she was talking to this other girl
Because of grammar?
 :pensive_face: 
lmaoo
i am not jealous of incorrect grammar
No I meant when you stopped talking because of grammar
yes
Ugh this is why you need to suck it up to get the girl back
no we made up after the fight
but we just couldnt talk non-awkwardly after that
so we stopped talking
but agreed
13 yo mish did not agree
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
You guys were so cute tho
I can't believe grammar ruined your future with this girl
You had a wedding date  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo
I can't
mhm
that date passed
i think i was 3 days away from graduating
idk why we thought we were gonna get married at 17
Hahah
oh no
remembered another down bad thing i did
Do share
instead of saying "laughing” she said "laugh”
once
and i said "ing”
and then i said sth like
you're laugh and i'm ing bc you can exist without me but i cant  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and i still thought this was bestie behaviour
Why would you say that  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Omg mega in denial
indeed
there was so much that happened
Seems like she felt similarly tho
yeah
she changed her bio to
So why would you say she can exist without you
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
"she is the reason i get up everyday”
with the emojis
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
MISH
I can't do this
idk
Thats the cutest thing I've ever heard
maybe i didnt say exist
i think i said
pointless
idk
something along those lines
That's not better  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
ppl kept talking about mishtal a lot
She's the reason I get up  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
it got to the point where some random person dm'd me being like
"hey mishtal!”
like they thought that my name was mishtal
The ship name :loudly_crying_face: 
How are you in denial after the ship name
the ship name came extremely early
Also I don't want to hear anything about how you weren't officially dating
You were both so in love it's causing my physical pain
we were not
Like heartache
Oh come on
She's the reason I wake up every morning
alexander  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Dtiydk
yooy
there may or may not have been a joint account
It's wordle was a thing when you guys were also a thing she totally would have done mossy
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  mishtal
oh my god
that is true
i think
13 year old Mish in love is the cutest thing ever
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
she wrote a casual post on one of her accounts where i wasnt v present
it was like
"i asked my mum to buy me an iphone but she said no cause i'd never text anyone. what about mish ?”
and then she said
"you dont know who mish is”

<Media omitted>
from the b99 subreddit  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Haha

Because it was awk after that

That's so sad
Omg
I'm going to cry
I'm actually going to cry I'm too invested
Lmao I also wanna see in love mish adult version

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Via cuteness heart attack
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh just generally, I feel like I've been doing a lot with my bits recently so please tell me if any of my jokes actually make you uncomfortable or go too far, I really don't want that
They don't
Please don't worry
Ok maybe the rant thing on the bike was a bit too much
But it did not make me uncomfortable
Also I have issue with this, I know I make fun of you sometimes, but this is very far from true.
Ok that's the end of serious sentimental segment
I know
I'm sorry
Shouldn't have said that
No no it's okay, I can see where you get the impression from  :grinning_face_with_sweat:  :grinning_face_with_sweat:  :grinning_face_with_sweat: 
noo
I know you don't
I didn't mean it
also
should you be maybe sleeping
it's 1am
I still have not gotten out of bed
There's a distinct possibility I should
Hard to say for sure
have i just been keeping you up with my relationship that wasnt a relationship from 7 years ago
Idk, my heath needs to slowly down after all the mishtal stories
It totally was
i didn't even know i liked girls  :loudly_crying_face: 
If that wasn't dating then love isn't real
Doesn't matter
You were in love with her
lmao
The next day and the day after and forever  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  it's too much
Ok sorry to go back to the serious sentimental segment (I guess that stops it from being a segment? or am I just creating another segment) I am fine w you making fun of me, I may be like "omg why are you so mean to me  :loudly_crying_face: ” but I really don't mind and it's kinda funny
it was too much
Got it :white_heart:  :white_heart:  message received my cute e-dater
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yooy
but also  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
mish I'm going to cry
I can't believe grammar ended it all
why?
it did
13 year olds are like that sometimes alex
 :loudly_crying_face: 
There's an alternate universe where crystal can use Google and you got married at 17 and I curse a cruel God that I'm not in that one
lmaoooo

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Ridiculous behaviour

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
This is true
That is, hearing about your life when you were 13
actual life was a bit awful btw
only online life was good
Mhmm yeah

Dtiydk

It seems you have a lot of love you give  :loudly_crying_face: 
To*
or w a man
Yeah, twice as many fish in the sea as others
i know right
i think about this all the time
Which isn't the point of the fish saying but oh well
how do i have the largest dating pool of anyone
 :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face: 
only ppl excluded are straight women and gay men
To be fair, there are quite a number of straight women
Oh and people who aren't attracted to you, but few and far between for those  :relieved_face: 
lmaooo
Was there a second half of this thought that you didn't feeling like saying
no?
Oh ok nvm
what did you think
Umm
Nothing
You just don't normally start thoughts with how do I...
Yk
 :upside-down_face: 
what
i am so confused
sad thing for a bi woman to say but
No I mean you don't normally start thoughts with "how do I, something" normally a, but afterwards
But nevermind
<Media omitted>
I think we're all a little confused sometimes
Life is confusing
Confucius said that
mhm
Staying on brand with the philosopher and name thing yk

Gonna get hit by a car
Have you gotten hit by a car

Home safe
Well done
Dentist appointment hurt  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
The pedo dentist was nicer
She used some whirry device instead of the normal metal hook thing
Not pleasant
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face: 
what did you get done
Oh just normal cleaning
Oh
right
My gums always bleed during those :)
But I have a cavity for the first time ever  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Ever???????
It was a point of pride that I've never had one
rip
Not any more :loudly_crying_face: 
England
yk my chem teacher told me it has to do w the water
Yeah classic UK bad teeth
like other water
usually has fluorine in it
but uk water lacks it or sth
I am now terrified to go to the dentist when I go home
That's silly
The water is probably fine
Esp since you buy yours
<Media omitted>
but like
a fun and quirky small gift yk
Haha it does
not a birthday gift
lmao
<Media omitted>
finally
i havent entered muji since i came to london
Is that fancy?
I've been to muji like 10 times before when i was in germany
i mean yes kind of
their stuff is v expensive
But I mainly go for the smell
Which sounds weird
Me neither
Yeah
I've told myself
When I get a fulltime job
<Media omitted>
the first not useful thing I will buy is
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
lmaoo
an aroma diffuser like a fancy electrical one
it's like 30 pounds for a small one 50 for a regular one
<Media omitted>
Oh yeah we have one of those at home
What  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm so jealous
My mum is not a fan of the smell of essential oils
Lmao just walked in to smell things
<Media omitted>
Devestating
<Media omitted>
I can't believe it
Unlikely I'll ever emotionally recover from this
mhm
me neither
<Media omitted>
my sister drew this  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Is this for little

by little
Lmaoooo
She knows her worth  :relieved_face:  :crown: 
ikr
Just got home
Teeth no longer suck
It's lit
mhm
i know
Hahah
I wanted to not text you as much when you were on your bike lmao
hence the voice messages
Right, appreciate that
focus on the road  :relieved_face: 
i mean ideally dont look at your phone at all but i am from mongolia that is something that nobody does
My dad generally makes me v nervous about this
Not texting and roading
?
Not texting
But like
He's not focussed enough
He's fumbling w stuff in the backseat
while driving
I'm just there like "I've got it” and he does not believe me
????
And then once I was in charge of the GPS  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  that was scary
He's driving and still would rather solo it than take your help
Did you turn off read receipts
 :pensive_face:  :pensive_face:  :pensive_face: 
What
No?
Oh what that was werid
Ok theyve gone blue
<Media omitted>
Try again
The screenshot is literally as the ticks are turning blue
lmao
and my dad told me I was incompetent and kept doing it himself even though I told him not to
Good timing,  :relieved_face: 
Why is everyone so mean to you  :loudly_crying_face: 
Tell me a time someone in Mongolia was nice to you
Uhh when that man returned my stolen phone
He was an angel
Oh that's nice  :smiling_face: 
I was being dumb
I had it in my blazer pocket
and these two guys snatched it
And then this man saw it happen from his car
Got out
Scolded them
Took my phone
 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  of course the nice person story starts with you getting robbed
But that is really nice, what a homie
Tried to find us
He picked up immediately when I realised it was gone
and he gave it back
King
lmaoo
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
Okay but that's not like they knew you, it was just stranger kindness
Yeah
Ugh
I can't believe
We downgraded from crystal to cmbyn girl
Lmaooo
I mean
there were like what 5 years inbetween
more than 5?
6?
Should have maintained your standards tho  :relieved_face: 
and then to yixin
which is a slight step up i believe
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  don't say that
Really?
She was that bad
She was not that bad
Like her personality is fine
Except for extreme unreliability
Actually I know very little about her other than that she ghosted you
Yeah so she's kind of a girlboss
=> attraction
actually that's wrong
girlboss =/> attraction
otherwise i'd be into genuinely everyone
are you doing anything
No
You deleted this message
I think they're talking about me
????
What
They're wispering
Sus
Oh my god
Lmaoo
<Media omitted>
probably something like "hes on call with a girl  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear: "
they are both very nosy

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Nutford is empty  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yes
and jean is still at ucl
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I feel like
Joyce probably knows I'm into girls at this point
We've had so many floor conversations
and now I'm screaming
about girls  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaooo
oh no
shes not friends with yixin is she
No
Yixin asked me who my fav RA was
And I said Joyce
and he was like
oh right beef
Joyce is nice but she's a chatterbox
and a gossip
i'm like "so am i@
Joyce is the blonde one right
No
She's ethnically Indian
oh right yeah
shes sat with us a couple times right
she seems nice
oh no
but if joyce is a chatterbox
nah she wouldn't thats too far
yeah i dont think so
also cause she's an ra
yeah she probably has a lot of other hotter gos to talk about
if shes inclined to gos
i think she is sensible enough to not talk about this
<Media omitted>
banger

 :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm scared
that next year there'll be people who regularly use the piano and I'll have to sneak into convienet times and feel bad about takign it from others
how do you know that there'll be ppl who regularly use the piano
thats my fear for next year
ohh
its unlikely, but even one or two regular users is enough to offset the balance
i think youre ok
even if there are one or two regular users
but they'll probably be really good  :loudly_crying_face: 
who cares  :loudly_crying_face: 
so like
I'm bad and I'm taking up a grand piano even though they're mega cracked
yk
You have the same right to use the grand piano as the mega cracked ppl
hold on my finger is being weird
turn it off and on again
ok its still weird
it feels like its bruised and swollen
oh well
it's fine
???
what happened
show
idk
its not actually bruised and swollen
it just feels like it
like if you press on one bit its v painful
 :pensive_face: 
may I reccomend not pressing on that one bit
yw no worries
that'll be 5000$
usa
US healthcare system  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
i dont think ive ever had dinner faster
that sounds wrong
this is the fastest i've ever had dinner
you know what i mean
?
Sounds right
Omg
I speed ran meals in early Nutford ers
Because I didn't talk to anyone  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah I'm p sure you left me alone once because you were done w dinner
Did I?
that was like either the first or 2nd time I talked to you
Sorry lmao
You were sitting alone so I came to you
and we had an awkward conversation about you missing your cambridge offer
Lmaooo
and then i was like
oh yeah same
i mean not same
bc yk oxford
god it feels v weird talking about that now?
Yeah, UCL is the rejects squad  :sad_but_relieved_face: 
bc like
Does it?
yeah
cause it does not me talking about you
not feel like*
it feels like i'm talking about a diff person lmao
Oh yeah that
Yeah we had a few interactions in the beginning where I didn't really do the whole, you know, be me thing
That's to everyone tho
I def forgot your name like 3 times tho  :loudly_crying_face: 
Really bad with names
Even though yours is pretty ubique
I remember trying to remember it one time and thinking it's kinda unique and m sound
But couldn't get it
M sound  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm p sure I only mention my name like once and follow it up immediately w "but everyone calls me Mish”
and then nobody knows my actual name until they follow my social media or whatever
You're still Misheel on WhatsApp for me
Yeah I know
<Media omitted>
I get v happy when it's my actual name but I realise it's probably just bc you saved it from Whatsapp
i know what this is before i even play it
indeed
Um actually its because I put in Misheel  :double_exclamation_mark:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  (this is a lie I don't remember, and you're probably right)
lmaoo
Was Elvin Hall the one we were in for explore econ?
it was right
Sounds about right
Why
Gonna be there tomorrow
That's not a very big room  :upside-down_face: 
That's photography
lmao
Oh right
How long do they have you there for
8-12.30
Omg
The document does not tell me how much the photos are to purchase
it's like "assist graduates and guests with questions they might have” and one of the questions is clearly gonna be "how much is it gonna be?” and they've not told us  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
 :skull:  that's a while
Just look it up
hey day after tomorrow is even more fun
8am-8pm
Detective Mish on the case  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
????????
That's a long time
How much are they paying you
11.72 per hour
<Media omitted>
They take pictures in ioe underground then have to walk 7 minutes to buy them  :skull: 
I doubt it
no i mean
after the graduation
there's a drinks reception on the quad
yoy
zaza
i guess there's tomorrow
zaza
to ask
about
That's a new one
<Media omitted>
honestly surprised it's that low
For zaza
yea
<Media omitted>
mhm
what does zaza mean
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
What is this lmaoo
"10 phrases you shouldn't go to mongolia without”
LMAOOO
And half of them are just variations of za
no this is just one
Right got it
<Media omitted>
Okay
That, surprisingly, actually does explain it
Really getting representation for underappreciated letters with yoy into zaza
theyre not underappreciated in mongolia
actually yo is
now i'm on this website
Yoy is?
and am reading an article on top 5 things that make learning mongolian difficult
yo is a letter ë
Right
yoy is written ёой
so technically it's yooy
Oh no
That's a lot of things
ë is yo
o is o
й is an -y sound
A negative y
 :face_screaming_in_fear: 
lmao
<Media omitted>
lmao
Oh no
That's too many things
a word i say often to my mum
when she's like what did you do
"i was out w my friends”
Right popular like that
you know i'm usually talking about GASM right
Yeah
Lmao
Not anymore tho
<Media omitted>
Just GM
or MG
The l sound  :loudly_crying_face: 
aka me hanging out alone
Grandmaster or milligramme
Up to yoi
Oh right lmao
<Media omitted>
this  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
is why i struggled so much w mongolian grammar and would make like 50 spelling mistakes
???? Why do this
Just don't lmao
German does this too tho right
the "mdku” sound during sugar mama
Make a mega word by combining a bunch
german barely does it in comparison to mongolia
No
Mitiku?
Not that
It's actually medekhgui
Lmao
<Media omitted>
Wait what are the constituent parts
what constituent parts?
are you eating lunch
will you eat lunch
<Media omitted>
I'm leaving rn
so apparently it's only welsh and mongolian
to the library?
Lunch
leaving lunch or leaving to lunch
confusion
That's why ethan can do it
Leaving to lunch
oh ok
Of mitiku
What
Medeh is know
then -gui is a negative suffix
so medehgui becomes dont know
and the way it's usually pronounced is midku
it's not an actual word
it's like saying dunno instead of dont know
Right
So one of the only Mongolian words I know is fake  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's an actual word
She's saying medehgui
but it's pronounced midku
and ppl sometimes say midku
Actually she might be saying midku
lets check
I thought it was midiku
Is there no I sound after the d
i
i mean there's supposed to be an e sound after the d
because thats how the actual word works
but i would say mdku is the most common way to do it
Oh no i at all
<Media omitted>
she says it properly
but the way she pronounces it is the lazy way
<Media omitted>
as in the lyrics say "medehgui”
Whoahh
That's a lot of sounds
I like the way she says it
It sounds like a cute sneeze when you say it
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Good to know  :relieved_face: 
Lmaoooo
Targeted
sorry i am just talking at you
It's alright, enjoy learning about different forms of mitiku
ok
Ok
Have you ever thought about how Ok looks like a person
Um
It's a woman
And she's short
Mongolian
Hair always in a bun
may or may not wear glassesp
<Media omitted>
What are you saying
Pretty cheerful
Ohhh
LMAOO
Lmaoooo
are you talking about yourself
No
?
I was not
I was thinking of the lady who works in the grocery store
that's close to our apartment
Everything other than the bun fits
I am above average for an east asian woman
also above average for a mongolian woman
This??
<Media omitted>
first maths professor at ucl
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Would not agree most of the time
I feel like I am cheerful about fun stuff

Was this at ucl
Or did you buy a poster
Yes
Yeah definitely  :smiling_face: 
In the De Morgan study room
There's a DeMorgan's study room

Good idea
Nws :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Fair enough, but you're in London
You can be jealous once you get home

The graduation supervisor, not the more beautiful in person one right?
yes
each zone has a supervisor
my photography supervisor is german

Oh it's lit
i am standing in the least photography bit
okay
Does being German make her a girlboss
????
yes she's super organised
What does this mean lmao
ie after theyre done w photography
they are supposed to wait in a hall before the ceremony
Well good for her but that's also playing into stereotypes so
Wait
Me you and Jean are all Asians doing maths
Dang
yes
Stereotypes
Not fighting the stereotypes at all
But I am also a woman doing maths
slightly fighting stereotypes?
Yeah okay you get points for that
mhm

good night  :white_heart: 
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
(i cant believe i saw jiguang yu)
I'm surprised you're still standing tbh
You got scared seeing a month old email when you opened your inbox
Can't imagine what having him talk to you would do
ikr
WAIT

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

I'm tired just thinking about standing around dealing with people for 12 hours
there are barely any ppl in here
I am so chill
Oh that's kinda lit

We're so overstaffed
I managed to snag shifts before they realised they were overstaffed lmao
Haha well done
And now you're getting paid to sit around

<Media omitted>
standing next to the piano now
How often do you need to do that
It's lit
Play a little jig
idk theyre about to start flowing in
like maybe like once a minute or sth
be like straight ahead then left
And they don't give you a chair, you need to stand the whole time
Lmao rivetting stuff
Try wiggling your toes, helps with blood flow
That is helpful
I mean i walk like 6 steps
theres more ppl here now
Oh no
Actually need to do things  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
saw jiguang
<Media omitted>
Sending Thoughts and prayers

I thought you had a 6th sense for knowing whos mongolian or not
tsk tsk loosing your touch

bc theres too many

I caught like one muffled thing

that normally gives it away

lmao
I'm kind of an exception  :nail_polish: 
mhm

this isn't surprising as you're working

<Media omitted>

<Media omitted>
Stalking is an exaggeration, I checked to see you weren't at Nutford, that's it, but probably Tesco?
Mhm
That was a really cute yioy  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why was your voice so high
idk thats what i associate w yioy
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
I can't do it
<Media omitted>
It totally doesnt
But that sound reminds me of a ballon deflating
Totally doesnt sound like a ballon deflating that is
<Media omitted>
Nws
They call me the clarifier back where I'm from
Because of my tendancy to clearify things
Wanna watch b99
Yes
Give me a minute to turn my laptop on and such
I am so exhausted
Truely a mystery
How did it take 90 minutes to watch 2 20 minute episodes lmao
the thing didnt work
then i kept pausing
Still rather impressive if you ask me
mhm
yooy
?
<Media omitted>
i am tired
thats almost authentic
Wow thanks
very tired
also pandora's box has been opened
and i am v emo
if that is not clear already
 :loudly_crying_face:  I'm sorry
It's fine
Emo as in emotional not like mega sad right
yes emotional
no worries
ok i am gonna crash at any monent
so good night
 :white_heart: 
Goodnight :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
i also wrote her a list w 100 reasons why i loved her
omg
i just remembered this
yooy
thats too cute
young love sounds great
yeah
this was during a night when she had a rly bad fight w her mum
and she was practically losing it
and she went to sleep
that so sweet of you
you're such a sweetheart
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and yours truly started writing lmao
 :relieved_face:  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
Did you post on her acc too
not this particular thing
that was private iirc
The appreciating posts appearing when waking up tho
So cute
yeah that happened on a p regular basis
but not regular enough for it to be expected
it was always a surprise
That's still so cute
Got me blushing in the library
you're at the library?? already??
It's a 3 minute bike ride
oh
ok
aw lmao
and you're not even involved  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
paper reading besties indeed
I was listening to wildest dreams a second ago
yeah
While you were talking about that stuff
Put me in the feels
On your behalf
omg
you know when i first started listening to this song
I have a guess
it was during prime mishtal time
 :relieved_face:  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
ie before it was even a single
Before it was cool
back then it was just a random song on the album
yeah
ok i will continuously be losing it for the next week or so
Nothing wrong with that
I think it's valid "loosing it" material
also bc something happened after that unrelated to that which made me terrified to ever express feelings which is a bit sad ngl  :upside-down_face: 
Oh no, I'm sorry  :pensive_face: 
as in any affectionate feelings towards anyone lmao even if it's platonic
I know you know, but if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm more than happy to listen
thank you  :white_heart: 
i am fine but also it's a bit sad ngl
ok
I should really sleep
my god
yooy
yioy
I am not tired anymore
Lmaoo
which is annoying
How's that work
I need sleep
I think you'll probably sleep if you put your head on a pillow and close your eyes
start losing it => wake up
my head is on a pillow and my eyes were closed for 15 mins
I mean you can sleep till like 830 tomorrow
yeah i know but i need to shower and not miss breakfast
lmao
Right
Read that as Mish breakfast
and i will not get up and shower immediately
interpret it either way  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
And thought you were referring to not eating anything
 :unamused_face:  :unamused_face: 
<Media omitted>
This one is funny
lmao
When are your alarms set for
starting from 7.30
till 8.30
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yeah its fine
Is this normal for you
ok good night  :white_heart: 
Ok goodnight  :white_heart: 
ok good night  :white_heart: *
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :white_heart: 
I've been out of the back cracking game for a bit, but I just hit some nice ones both ways, feels good
<Media omitted>
lmaoo
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Good morning
Wow only 10 minutes of alarms to wake you up
good morning
Adult behaviour
i know
mhm
And now you get to do nothing in bed for 45 minutes
Very clever
mhm
or i sleep for another 10 mins
and then do nothing for 35 mins
You'd normally get made fun of for mhm's but I'll let it pass given the 15% awakeness I'm presuming were running at
thanks
Nws
or i keep snoozing alarms
And then be conscious at the right time  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  (now)
Last alarm coming up soon
mhm
<Media omitted>
Ok 3/7 mhms
You're getting bullied for mhm's now because you need to be awake  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
why 7?
Always listening
Estimate
ok
Oh I meant 3/7 of the last messages
We're mhm
oh
lmao
i dont want to go
i am so tired
thats a lie
It'll be fineee
Oh fr?
but getting myself to go is tiring
fr
Yeah it'll be fun  :double_exclamation_mark:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
even though most of the ppl on my shift are not students  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
??? Who are they then
I thought it's just UCL people they hire
random ppl that unitemps hired or ucl staff
Righr
Right
Still, it'll probably be fun to be around new random people
yeah
one of them is the lady who supervises the open days for technical reasons lmao
What're you doing today? Not photos again right
drinks reception
What does this mean
Right
What does that entail
like recording the zoom meeting
Oh the open days are on zoom right
i need to read the drinks reception document
the open days that are coming up are in person
Oh thats fun
Think people will show up to those?
yes
I actually really want to do UCL and department stuff
it's gonna be v full
I feel like it's really cool and fun
it is
bc it's a ucl wide open day
Oh what
so ppl who arent even sure what to apply for are gonna show up
Are you doing that then?
yeah but i'm only helping w the set up and take down for the general ambassadors thing and doing departmental stuff on the actual open day
ie dept will be paying me lmao
<Media omitted>
I'm gonna pretend like I understood that
can i snag a jeremy beartham?
i'm gonna ask to be merch staff if they let me lmao
A what? Do they sell little statues of him
no a teddy bear
with a grad cap
Awww what that's lit
theres also some w hoodies
as in ucl hoodies
theyre cute
The bears wearing UCL hoodies
yes
If you get free merch I'm going to be so jealous
i dont think i will
 :pensive_face: 
but last time the reception ppl snagged popcorn
That's basically the same thing
drinks reception is at the ioe
on the one day (1) that i'm working at it
 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Do you get to snag drinks  :exclamation_question_mark:  :exclamation_question_mark: 
i hope so but i doubt it
you need a drink token
and each guest can only have one
Ugh
bc theres too many ppl
So stingy
mhm
I mean catering cant even get like
sandwiches for like 100 ambassadors
And they're having your work for so long  :loudly_crying_face: 
Where does all the tuition go to
yeah we were talking about that
that some of the tuition we pay goes back to us bc we're working lmaoo
Probably making cool buildings like 1-19 torrington place  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
Hahahh true
ok
girl's gotta shower
and you should sleep
probably?
Probably not

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>

Earlier

Right

Don't we all
yes
Drinks is cool too tho
Those are fancy
some of it is just standing there and answeri ng ppls qs  :loudly_crying_face: 
Im sure everyone has to stand there and answer ppls qd
qs
that is true
It's not as cool when I misspell abbreviations
but tell ppl where the flowers are??
Oh that's kinda lit
Then everyone has to like you because positive association
You'd be the flower girl  :cherry_blossom: 
Yes
i left my earbuds
thats annoying
 :loudly_crying_face:  that's deveststing

I just saw a brutally murdered pigeon being eaten by a seagull
<Media omitted>
Cool
did some insane neck cracks just now
ppl are about to come out of the 2nd ceremony
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
i am here to tell them to go to the quad for drinks
How are drinks
That's your job, no actual drinks involved
?
lmao
interesting
mainly confused ppl not being able to find the print room cafe from the quad
i tell them "through this door *point at south cloisters*, downstairs, then outside”
Oh that's confusing tho
cause the container like pop up learning quad thing opposite the print room cafe is where they need to drop it off
And that's our secret passage way
It is
they put some more ppl at the stairs towards the end
to help them find it
Right
Actually necessary
the worst thing about this thing im doing rn is that i have to shoo them from the ioe to the main quad when they're just chatting
But it's kinda funny they hired a bunch of students just to be glorified arrows
and being happy
i know
lmao
but then again they ask me other stuff as well like
where can i pick up photos
or where's the toilet?
And you're not getting to be happy   :loudly_crying_face: 
Do you know the answer
yes
Slay
i am happy
ok maybe not at this exact moment
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
but i am contempt
bc my feet hurt
Haha right
Right got it
i want to be at the merch stand
:((
Have you been wiggling your toes
they keep putting me for directional
We all want to be at the merch stand
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
ucl ties
ok ppl are comi ng out
gtg
It's not a real place more a concept to demonstrate inobtainability
lmaoo
nvm
those were just ioe ppl who were dressed nicely
so i thought they were guests
Merch stand is kinda fire
ok theyre out now
Wait aren't you in the main quad
What do you have ioe people
i am
but first i need to guide them from the ioe to the main quad
Oh you take groups?
no
theres like ppl positioned rverywhere
im like keep going down
Idk why I'm having guy describe where you are when I can just track you
Oh wait you're in the ioe now? Whatever just tell me later
yes
the last reception is gonna be at the ioe
so now
we're setting up at the ioe
Setting up cool
I had a dream that I was in Mongolia, but it was like just Mongolia in name, it was really some resort with a bunch of water and friendly sharks
And everyone spoke English, but at some point I remembered it was Mongolia and was all like have any of you guys picked up and Mongolian and they were all like no so I got to show off my skills
lmaoo
resort w water and friendly sharks?
re-explain  past "any of you guys”
Oh it was my family, another family and two of my aquantiances from middle school
Idk why they were there
Like idk what they were doing there in the dream but I also don't know why they were in the dream, have not interacted with then in forever

 :OK_button: 
This is theoretically less effort as its only one character
mhm
Try as I might I will never best the Queen of low effort responses (this isn't to say your responses are always low effort, just that when they are, they are very low effort)
got mhm to an explanation of an emoji not even mhmm
I'm in shambles
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
sorry
I am v tired?
<Media omitted>
No need to apologize for besting me, I played your game and I was defeated
besting you?
I now need to make all my messages semi formal and long winded
In low effort
Idk what I'm saying
Maybe just ignore me if you're busy, talk to you once you're done?
okay
 :OK_button:  :OK_button:  :thumbs_up:  :thumbs_up:  :thumbs_up:  :OK_button:  :OK_button:  :OK_button:  :OK_button:  :OK_button:

her most famous song  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
You knew the other ones tho
I sang this song at karaoke
And could recognize the other ones
And you didn't want to sing Taylor swift  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Next year
For sure
As in
private karaoke
We rented a room for 60k on this girl's bday
and there were 12 of us
so 5k
ie 1.25 pounds
Wow that's really cheap
You know what's cheaper than 1.25£ tho? Free Taylor swift karaoke
So free talent show take me to church based karaoke
take me to church based  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i am gonna fall apart
I am So Tired
That is acceptable
Why did you manually capitalize all those letters
idk
it puts a different emphasis on the words
Especially when your tired and capitalization signifies loudness
Oh ok
Fair enough
mhm
Sleep then?
I think I will get under my blanket
When is pride tomorrow
sleep may or may not come
Gaurav and I are going at 2pm
Aren't you very tirdd

Yes
<Media omitted>
I am gonna die
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Should I name drop you when I hit him up
but he's been the main dude
Because you're such a star
Probably
lmao

I mean not everyone gets components on how well they can give directions
It's lit  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
compliments

Yeah
lmaooo
I mean I doubt everyone gets components either
But that doesn't add much to my argument
lmao
I am so tired
But not sleep tired
 :upside-down_face: 
Leg tried

 :upside-down_face:  indeed
Yes
Happy 2nd
Pride?

I dont have anything pink
Unlucky
If I had a pink scarf
i could use it as a like bandana type thing
purple top
blue jeans
Boom pride
Wait is it red on top?
No
It's pink
Yep it's definitely not
I know you think it's red
Hahah
Yeah
That's embarrassing
Didn't tell me the first time
and it's cute bc you kept doing the heart thing
 :upside-down_face: 
and i did not have the heart to tell you
pun unintended
Hahah
I would not have been stricken with grief had you told me  :loudly_crying_face: 
I know
But it's cute
it's like
Saulet saying fielding medal
I even looked it up to make sure I had the right order  :loudly_crying_face:  and then i was like yep that's totally red
Awww  :white_heart:  :loudly_crying_face: 
WAIT
There's no pink heart
 :sparkling_heart: 
there's only
This doesn't count
 :growing_heart: 
That isn't uniform with the rest
So I totally did know it was pink all along
Lmaoo
 :red_heart:  :purple_heart:  :blue_heart:   :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
lmao
leg pain is getting worse

Uhhh
Stretch, heat, flex different bits to release the muscle
Show me your calfs, that's also important
lmaoo
Okay but seriously the first 4 things help
Idk where you'd get a warm towl or something

listening to girli and
<Media omitted>
 :skull: 
What I wouldn't give to be following mishtal at its peak
lmaoo
honestly yk thats my fear
someone i'm gonna meet at uni's gonna be like your name is familiar  :skull: 
If mishtal has 1000 fans I am one of them if mishtal has 100 then I am one of them if mishtal has 1 fan it is me if mishtal has no fans I am not alive
and then it'll turn out they followed me during peak mishtal time
lmao  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I was thinking about that
Do you live in constant fear of this prospect
Actually this guy today told me I look familiar
Because like 10,000 followers
Insane
He's like I know you from somewhere
And I had no idea
And if you don't remember someone
and I asked him the very few thinfs that I do on the campus
No way they can remember you
and we have no overlap
not really
but occasionally
We're most of your fans Australian?
I can't imagine there were that many Mongolians
Australian no 1
Then British 2
British  :skull: 
1 mongolian actually
but she's american
You
Oh nvm
She goes to Pomona College now
CMBYN girl considered going there
bc they gave her an extremely personalised acceptance video
They told her exactly what they liked about her and her application
Whattt
That's crazy
They were down bad for her
Yeah
<Media omitted>
Why didn't u apply to the us? Too much work?
Ninter sow adel
Agreed!
Yeah and I was p sure it wasnt worth it cause I wasnt gonna get in anywhere cause I didnt do extracurriculars
Sister saw Adele
Oh right
Why did my sister just say
"not a big fan of her”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
helloooo???
its adele
Because i don't speak Mongolian
Didn't put that together somehow
Is she not allowed to not be a fan of adele
I mean the reaction was a little dry
yes
Emulen adeliig amitan gej bodson :sad_but_relieved_face: 
But you're not really allowed to be surprised by that
True
I know you dont understand
But
I cant
this is so funny
"Emulen thought Adele was some sort of animal”
LMAOO
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why is that a  :crying_face:  emoji anyway
But that's really cute  :loudly_crying_face: 
idk
My sister is judging me for being tired
The audacity
Lmaooo
As in not wanting to call or something
Or just being tired
No I called
And she was like
Why are you tired
 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
And I was like
Is emulen talking to you?
I've been on my feet for the past two days
not since last time
but i havent called back home in a while
it's fine
<Media omitted>
she has viewed my close friends story
which i have not removed her from
Emulen?
also i have not been removed from hers
No
Munguldei  :loudly_crying_face: 
cmbyn girl
Why haven't you removed her  :skull:  :skull:  :skull: 
that is a v good question to ask
the answer to which is unknown
Do it now?
i shall wait
Wait does she have a public account with Charlie brown as the pfp or has she changed it
she changed it
Only remember the pfp because you spent so long stressing over weather to press the story
Ok lmao
lmaooo
Ok
ok
Oah kay

My dogs are actually impressively stupid
They don't really like their dry food but can't eat any human food without throwing it back up
Which never stops them from begging
But anyway they get disappointed when there is dry food
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But they've managed to associate the sound of the bag crinkling with food about to appear in their bowls
But have *not*  associated it with dry food
So every time we give them dry food
They get excited and sniff around around and skuttle along the floor
Then once dry food is poured they're always surprised and disappointed
And they'll look over their shoulder at us being like "really?"
What now???
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That's why I said impressively stupid
lmaoo
that's kinda cute thiugh
It is
Oh and peach is definitely the alpha
explain
Because there are two bowls and peach chooses one then Yoshi either waits for her to move away or chooses the other one
Lemme see if I can get it on video
Oh nvm Yoshi lost interest
But in the beginning of yosh would try to eat from the bowl at the same time peach would attack
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Make vicious sounds and such
poor yoshi
peach defending her territory!
Poor Yoshi indeed

The Japanese olympic volleyball team has an isikawa on the men's and women's team
They're siblings!

Yeah, I think it's actually pretty common to have olympic siblings
Built in besties  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
is it bad that i saw "like the sequences” and immediately thought you were referring to conditionally convergent sequences
Conditionally convergent series tho  :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

But I will dig it up when I'm back home

this is one of those jokes
where it's cheesy but not good
but enough to make me smile
Nope
Made you smile
It's a good joke
Checkmate
ok
Ok
Your fault the joke is good, you're fueling the bad humour
alright
agree to d
sample size is too small
???
to draw a proper conclusion
i am v tired
You're the only person I told the joke to right then
as you can tell
yes
Even though I've made that joke a bunch of times
But that's unrelated
So the goal was to make you smile/laugh, goal was accomplished therefore, good joke
that makes sense
Agreed
okay

rarity in the mish brunch/breakfast collection
Joyce came up to me at brunch and asked if I've been okay recently
She was like
if you need to talk
I'm here
Oh no she overheard
I was like
Did you hear anything
She was like "it wasnt like ‘oh my god' but like just wondering if you're okay and if you wanna talk i'm here”
Oh my god
And Gaurav was there
and he was like what's going on
so I said I would tell him eventually
Oh my god
I can hear Joyce talking on the phone
I hear every word she's saying
Aren't you at pride?
We're leaving in 14 mins
Ok
Haha
Oh no
How are you awake at 6am
That's how it be
Have I outed myself to Joyce
lmao

Lmaoooo
I was so embarrassed
I doubt she heard words
Yooy
She probably just heard me screeching
I should stop screeching
You only hear words if you're trying to
But it's funny

What happened
How was pride btw, sounds like it was fun
I just completely lost it and forgot what I was gonna say
It was fun
Saw Ava Max
And GIRLI
even though Gaurav seemed eager to go back to the parade which I understand ngl
and lots of pride stuff
As in you forgot what you were gonna say in front of him or what you were gonna tell me
<Media omitted>
Lmaooo

I approve of it tho
a law firm apparently
 :face_screaming_in_fear:  :face_screaming_in_fear:  so embarrassing  :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
No I was like "Yixin”
Oh right fair
Then I just stared at him for a solid 10 seconds
maybe not 10
5?
Lmaooo
Okay that is pretty embarrassing
Yes that was bad
It was rly bad
I wish to never remember it again
Yixin has been here for the past 2 days

Try putting a towl over a kettle
Then using the warm towl on sore muscles

The paper is too hard to understand so I'm just going through the textbook

vegetarian option today is actually really good
<Media omitted>

I'm gonna go home and use chickpeas more in my cooking
ever since nutford
the rice at nutford is always mid tho  :unamused_face: 
ive become a fan of chickpeas
chickpeas are good
todays is actually okay
I'd likely do the same if I could cook
mhm
I had not had chickpeas before nutford
mmhhmm
like ever?
yes
 :crying_face: 
my grandpa is a fan I think
they sell some
near where i live
so gonna get those
fun and exciting!
Looking forward to receiving food pictures when you go home
Yes
Will vlog
There will also be my sisters in the bg screaming
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
My cooking is usually interrupted by them screaming
Or fighting
maybe they've matured in the last year
Then I have to stop cooking to separate them
never know
They did not
hahah
I called my mum today
and they were fighting in the bg
It was very distracting
I got stressed from just talking to my mum
fighting about what
lmao
idk
like sth stupid
or one of them punched the other
you never know
I used to fight with my brother allllll the time
it was like a daily thing
it's not a daily thing
it's a 30 minute thing
and then one day it jus stopped
hahah
It happens every 30 mins
sometimes for all the 30 mins
that means the fights last less than 30 mintues tho :D
no
this
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Does mongolian sauce have brown sugar, ginger soy sauce, and garlic?
<Media omitted>
You say sauce
???
there is no sauce
in mongolia
Most mongolians don't know brown sugar exists  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Like I asked my dad to pick up brown sugar from a big big grocery store for baking once and he was like "??? brown sugar”
we use soy sauce but that's just like an extra not traditional
Okay, will let them know they're living a lie
ok
lemma 3.4 proved
finally
it's super ugly though
it's super inconvenient
i dont get the point of doing this
but  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
I am so fucking stupid
Oh my god
<Media omitted>
I am genuinely the dumbest person ever
scrap all the proofs i did
yooy
I misunderstood the statememt
That looks fun
You'll have to fight me for that title
nutford house boxing day?
 :double_exclamation_mark: 
I am really really stupid
Ughhh now I'm just mad at myself
Happens  :person_shrugging: 
More practice  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Channel your anger into girlbossing
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yoy
Yioy
I am thinking whether I should ask her to postpone it
the meeting
This genuinely infuriating
What happened
But I'm sure that wouldn't be a problem
Since you're girlbossing so much recently
The problem has become sth completely different
I do not understand how someone can be as stupid as me
All this time we use f^n to mean " the function f applied n times "
Also happy naadam!
I think
and I used f^n to mean power of f
July 11th
But thank you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But it would have been celebration today?
Isn't your whole paper thing on repeating functions?
Yeah they were celebrating in London today
I knowp
But then
Listen
The exercise
That she gave me
Was
Using norms
and I've done way too many proofs that are similar to this
I hate norms  :enraged_face: 
with norms
and powers of functions
that I automatically assumed that when she wrote f^5 she meant f to the power of 5 rather than f applied 5 times
I am so stupid
This is unbelievable
Ok sorry
I know you're busy
Yeah that's an acceptable mistake
Happens
If you wanna do it later BC you're girlbossing all the time that's ok
The meeting that is
yeah
I'll email in the morning
I cannot believe my stupidity
Oh my god yooy
It happens
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Oh you're making macarons?
French cookie  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And they have a kitchenaid?? I'm so jealous
How did you figure that out
The circles on the baking sheet
Cmbyn girl made macarons once
Did they slap
I think so
She just sent me pics
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
macarons
or sth like that
Kinda fire
she's really good at baking
we had a thing where we'd send each other stuff we'd baked
<Media omitted>
Aw
lmaoo
4th of july macarons?
also are the coloured bits flavoured in any way or is that just food colouring
i'm assuming food colouring
Yeah
yooy
I'm so mad about the function thing
It's okay it happens, good thing you didnt spend tooooo long on it  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yoy
This way you'll have more time before meeting
This is good
We're bing chilling
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
You're right
But also I'm so mad at myself for being dumb
Yooy
I need to go walk around a bit
Okay
Have a good walk  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

Okay cheeky 9:15-10:30 nap
As you do
mhm
What're you doing then
scrolling through tiktok
about to drink tea
Sounds nice  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :cowboy_hat_face: 
maybe finish the really bad movie on amazon prime i was watching
Which one
I really wanna play volleyball
It looks so much fun
The hating game
with who
love is war
anyone, preferably people only marginally less athletically capable than me so I can do well without destroying
may I recommend the james acaster specials on netflix, they're v funny
lmao
I feel like I told you my story w volleyball right
that the pe teacher gave up on teaching me
and when i told my volleyball friend about this she was like "aw i can teach you”
and then gave up after 5 mins being like "nvm”
yeah I remember this
lmaooooo
dw I can teach you
I think I can give you like 8 minutes before I'll give up
lmaoo
im patient like that  :raising_hands: 
okay
I'm still gonna finish the really bad movie
Because I wanna know what happens
Im watching the trailer
I kinda wanna know what happens too
let me know, def not going to watch it
I mean they probably just fall in love and dont care about the job because  :red_heart:  :red_heart:  or something
lmaoo
what just happened is that:
oh wow very moral
they totally have sex anyway tho right
she got mad and left
they probably will
how far in the movie are you?
slightly more than halfway in
and they haven't had sex yet? snails pace  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
omg
they're doing the thing we thought was gonna happen in edinburgh
basically he took care of her and she was like "i owe you” before all of this i wanna be with you stuff
so he's like
be my +1 to my bros wedding
and he booked 2 hotel rooms
and they only have 1
omg that is so cheesy
but also how do you justify bringing a female coworker you allegedly hate yo your bros wedding
almost the as much denial as you were in
i mean he has beef w his family
jk not even close but still
so they dont talk much
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh my god
Sorry
More mishtal content
You know how I said I did the 100 reasons thing
never apologise for mishtal content
do whatever the opposite of apologizing is
"you're welcome in advance"
mhm
I think I told her everyday to pick a number
awwww
this is so cute, you were such a try hard
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
lmaooooo

AWWWW  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

<Media omitted>
AWWWWW
<Media omitted>

since I'll be dying
I am p sure I have screenshots of the rly long paragraphs that she wrote me
Which I probably wont share
But
yeah thats fair
not gonna throw a fit aobut that
will share certain phrases
although totally wouldn't mind
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ep19: your honour
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

why would I? thats not an embarassing user name
okay
"haha you used your name then appeneded it with a noun what a fool"
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
absolute tomfoolery
absolute buffonery
absolutey skylarking
absolute nonsense
absolute clowning
<Media omitted>
absolute foolishness
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

AWWWW
that's not try hard  :loudly_crying_face: 
midnight on valentines day
okay I guess calculating midnight isn't that much
but wishing her happy valentines day  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok maybe it's weird to keep going through these
you know the besties day  :loudly_crying_face: 
But it was a v cute young teen thing
even tho i was in denial
also weird to not tell me the account name  :pensive_face:  :unamused_face: 
 :skull: 
I feel like that makes it even cuter, its like you didn't know you were into her but you were just so in love you did all these embarassing cute things
its so adorable  :loudly_crying_face: 
embarrassing cute things indeed
thank god it was reciprocated lmaoo
the reciprocatoin def fueled it, wouldn't be that down bad if she wasn't down bad too
its like an echo chamber of down bad
that is true
lmaoo
until the grammar incident  :pensive_face: 
what is acc name now please :D
It was funny though
is it something like I love crystal
no
it is just embarrassing fangirl behaviour
bro
as in fangirl of youtubers
it is litteraly impossible to fan girl for anyone harder than you've been fangirling over crystal
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
its not that bad
share with the class
i feel like
(i am the class)
you have this strategy
omg
of telling me things are not embarrassing
and then being like its ok
now dish
I'm not gonna start roasting you about things once you've shared them
yeah I do because they're not embarassing
things are only embarassing if you think they are so if you just decide they aren't then they aren't
or like
it depends on what the person you're telling thinks about what they're hearing
so if I tell you I'm (Probably) not going to think its embarassing
then I proabbly wont
oh
today I saw one of daniel's baby cousins
who I until today forgot that I'm engaged to
Lmaooo
shes like 7 or something
but last year I think at our graduation party at daniels house
I was deemed "bully" by the tiny gril
oh no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
then at some point she was like I'm going to marry bully
it was v cute
aww
that is cute
i don't remember what I did to be deemed bully
Oh
I think she was trying to hit us with something and I reccomended she doesn't or something
also i realised that this seems like i think that you only say these things to get info and i know you totally don't and it's  genuine
lmaoo
hahah i know
my sister would call me an awful person for that
hahah
well I think I was deemed awful for it as well
then we played around for like another hour or something
I think being around daniel makes me funnier
idk I'm just making banger jokes 24/7
the daniel effect
not that I don't normally do that
maybe not 24/7 but agreed
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
yeah so whenever you're ready
take your time nws
Oh I was given an assignment by saulet to get a celebrity crush
any reccomendations
will take my time
a lot of time
did she also ask about your nutford crush again
uhh
yeah
 :crying_face: 
anya taylor joy?? first person that pops to mind since you said that that was the first time
i'm not gonna finish that
i'm too lazy to type
yeah I got it
she looks good in the queens gambit
when you google her tho, not so much
but i feel like someone who gives off e-girl vibes
would fit better
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
no but most of the girls you've sent me have e-girl vibes  :loudly_crying_face: 
thats not true  :loudly_crying_face:  but also thats just bc I have a nerd fyp
i am speaking based on evidence
so I dont get normal girls
hm
I'll ask you tomorrow  :relieved_face: 
are you gonna go
to dominic's for barbecue
In like an hour

My name is Alexander Yule, I'm starting year 2 at UCL next year. I got your contact from another student working on the graduations Misheel Ganzorig, however, if I muck everything up then I didn't get your contact from her, in fact, Vaania Achuthan was the one who gave it to me.
and she should be held accountable accordingly

Very exciting
My phone just yioyd very loudly
now mirzakhani is not the only woman w a fields medal
lmaoo
yioy
 :partying_face:  :partying_face: 
Well I mean I guess this in itself isn't a celebration thing
But this is  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
What did they do
yes
she does work on sphere packing
Like putting spheres in a box?
so basically trying to fit spheres into shapes
yeah
but 8 dimensional
Ah that's cool
That's a lot of dimensions
she proved that some lattice structure was the most efficient way to pack it or sth
<Media omitted>
I have no idea what that means so don't know if it's obvious or not (I'm assuming not) but good for her
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  math Queen slay
all 3 of them got it
i didnt predict june huh though
I forgot about the ICM until Jean texted me
and Jean texted me cause her mum texted her being like
a Korean got the fields medal
Oh nice!
What's the ICM
international congress of mathematics
also where they announce fields medal winners
Right
Did they just do it while you were sleeping
Also did they do the conference online or not at all
I'm not sure
online
BC it was gonna be in Russia right
Omg
You know what
?
You were probably the jiguang yu for the other a level maths people in Mongolia
You'd just grind math 24/7
Please dont say that I'm gonna kms
And make everyone else stressed
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
If prefer if you didn't  :cowboy_hat_face: 
I actually did not
I did a lot of maths but also bio chem phys
Dtiydk
and I dont think I went overboard really
You did analysis for fun  :neutral_face:  thats jiguang behaviour if there ever was
Oh
Back in like term 1
Before we knew you
Gaurav was like who at Nutford do you think is smart
He said you
What  :loudly_crying_face: 
Like we had chatted a little
But we didn't really know know you
lmao if anything Gaurav should've thought I was dumb
Not to say that knowing you has changed that
 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face: 
He and Matias tried to ask me for help
during term 1
I was of 0 help
Me when I can't do a question about history but I'm supposed to be smart  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's another subject my slime
It was just an integral
Oh nvm lmao
they translated it into maths for me
like a probability thing
Ok you know what integrals are hard
they asked why the probability was this divided bt sth
Who even remembers how to do them anymore
I definitely don't remember the quirky fun tricks
Agreed!!!!
Lmaoo
but that's nice
I dont give off smart energy during conversations I think lmao
Hot take
I feel like people discuss things and I'm just silent bc I have nothing to add
Ehhhhhh you can just not have any hot takes
Plus it's normally Mattias and Gaurav going off about something or other when you don't have anything to add
When it's Harry potter talk
You're going off
Lmaooo
Should you be maybe sleeping
what did you do today
after you hung up I went to domonicks
and it was v awk in the start
Right
because it was domonick and like 3 or 4 people I barely knew from middle/high school
but then other people showed up
and we played around with a volleyball for a bit
well that's fun right
people that I don't normally hang out with but are cool and I'm more comfortable hanging out with
played some chess, played some piano
grilled burgurs
chatted about life and such
then went home
it was fun
then I played games with leo and daniel for a bit
currently watching argentina vs canda in the mens volleyball nations league
I can watch live on this dubai sports channel
everywhere else you need to pay
its evne in english
argentina  is 24-16 in set 1
first to 25 each set, best of 5 sets
that sounds like a fun day
24-17
how do you manage to do so much stuff during the day
I was busy
girlie here does not understand
24-18
yeah but this was a lot of things for me
catching up?
I need to put the teddy bear in a box and ship it
yes
24-19
actually maybe coming back? unlikely
normally people make mistakes
24-20
Oh wow
argentina just sent it farrr out
theyre doing well
mhmm
this is canda coming back btw
okay
24-21
https://www.dubaisports.ae/content/dubaisports/livestreaming/channel-2.html
argentina is calling a time out
darn
argentina got
25
mhm
i just saw it
lmao
ohh okay if argentina touched the net
its candas point
I think its a desperation challenge though
<Media omitted>
ohhh
lmaoo
at domonicks barbeque
I was chatting with two of the peolpe who I'm kinda friends with
yeah
and they are playing volleyball in the park
and they invited me
so I'll go play volleyball with them sometime
its lit
okay

that's fun
goodnight  :white_heart: 
ok you sleep now
good night  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
thats a great idea
why didn't I think of that
idk
 :exploding_head: 
just my genius coming out here yk
yioy
I have to close WhatsApp when you're about to text something
So it yioys
lmaoo
did it yioy
Yes
It's very exciting
Are you papering it up?
I am in bed
Maybe paper it up a little
that's a good suggestion
Thanks
mhm
ok night  :white_heart: 
Ok goodnight  :white_heart: 
I'm gonna cry
Also I feel like I shouldnt message you as that's just a stream of "yioys”
But I'm watching the fields medal videos
and its rly cute how the mathematicians talk about their spouses
ok but also it took me till like my 4th rewatch to realise the joke during the whole holt and amy row about how amy was faking and then she says that it can be enjoyable for her without actually getting angry
I still don't get it
The more yioys the merrier
Awh nerds talking about their partners is always cute
https://youtu.be/biwX_TN5La0
what does this conversation remind you of  :loudly_crying_face: 
yeah
also i'm so tired for no reason
like i have not been able to do anything today
Oh no  :pensive_face:  are you getting out much? Try to be in the sun if you can. I realize you've been out a lot recently but idk
No I haven't been out
Uhh
I mean
I went to tesco to pick up water
(btw i keep thinking about your phone yioy-ing)
Is it sunny? Maybe try to sit outside for a bit
and I was v tired in the sun
Yeah it did hahaha
Ms girl in worried about you
i'm okay dw
just v tired
also don't be worried about me just now be worried about me on thursday
lmaoo
Lmaoooo how on earth did I miss that
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  I'm already worried about you on Thursday
no but fr
i am fine
just v tired
yooy
Yooooy
You shouldn't be tired for no reason tho
Oh
What did you eat today
Skip breakfast?
pot noodles
yes
 :neutral_face: 
they taste awful
why did i do that to myself
You're this close to losing your kneecap privileges
You need to eat food
lmaoo
Otherwise you'll feel crappy and tired
This is not surprising news
idk
this is a different type of tired though
No it isn't
 :neutral_face: 
it is
like
this is like a whole body tired
when im hungry
Yeah that happens when your whole body doesn't have energy
it's a "i feel weak”
tired
with trembling and stuff
You can not be hungry and still be malnourished
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  why do you do this to yourself
Ms girll
Mish I'm serious if you're not getting food you can trick yourself into but being hungry but you can't trick your body into making more energy
And your enormous brain can't work if the only thing you've eaten in the last 20 hours was crappy pot noodles
Not being hungry*
i'm fine
dont worry alex
i'll get dinner at 6
okay?
Okay.. hope you feel less tired soon  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Okay  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
also why do you keep waking up at like 6am  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh family was being loud
theyre back?
Johnny has to go to band
No, taking him out
right
He had half the day off after his 4th of July parade yesterday
Then he's back to full days  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Is he ok
Yeah he's really enjoying it I think
But it's such a huge time commitment
yeah
If you don't seriously enjoy all of it it would definitely be hell
Have you been papering it up or just existing
I have been existing
I finished the movie
Guess what happened
Sometimes we take an existing, decidedly better than not existing
 :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :red_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :red_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Is my guess
they had sex as soon as they got in the hotel room
Shocker
then she defends him in front of his dad who thinks he's a disappointment and his mum tells her he's been obsessed w her for a while
theyre still competing for the job
Aw
she overhears his convo w his boss and their plans to destroy her and she believes that he did all this to lead her on to get the job
and goes rampage mad
Mhmm saw that in the trailer
then they compete
and then turns out
And he sabotages himself
that he resigned
!!!!
got a different job
and she got it
But then she doesn't want him to leave  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and the reason he never told her is because her boss told him not to say anything
Mhmm
because he makes her competitive
so she'd beat everyone
Ohhhh
Cool
and then it flashes forward to them just being happy at his new job and her new job
Are they still together?
yeah
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :double_exclamation_mark:  :red_heart: 
Oh
I asked people the corn question yesterday
right
And two of them made a penis joke, like eat virtically for practice or something
Bro  :skull: 
That makes no sense
what now
???  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And nobody I've ever asked that before has made thar joke
Then 2/5 of these buffoons
how does this come to their minds
I don't know
i do not understand
They're like "it's obvious"
it is not
Agreed!
do they mean shove the whole cob of corn in ??? i'm so confused
No they said vertically
So like the analysis way? The less rotation efficient one
Weirdos
???
i dont understand how that's a dick joke
Yeah me neither
Worried for their future partners
same
Then again
Managed to miss all of this
So maybe it's just going over out heads
no but like
that's just us missing things
the corn thing just doesnt make sense

That's almost reasonable
If I feel tired
Okay.. but maybe go for a walk or something tomorrow
Have a nice breakfast
If I cancel you mean
Yeah
Yoy

This was really funny
Haven't watched the finale yet
oioioi
yoy
i'm so tired
yOy
<Media omitted>
but i put in a req anyways
Oh it's right there  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
exactly
That'd be wonderful
It would be
it comes out to 227 pw
which is exactly what we're paying rn
Oh no
and next year nutford is gonna be like 10 pounds more expensive
That's expensive  :crying_face: 
Do you have an idea for how much bills and food is gonna be
Also
so if i can convince them to include bills in the price
When is Beatrice gonna go back to Lithuania
She's not sure yet
Before or after big G's birthday
probably before
Why?
No reason
 :cowboy_hat_face: 
mhm
I meant Gaurav not the rapper

Good choice
<Media omitted>

M-pop is the next big thing
lmaoo
M standing for Mish obviously
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I forced wilfred to respond to me, I think my room is still secured
good job
do you think you will? how much does that stuff come out to?
normally, obv depends on how much yall use
it's usually like £15-20 pw
so uhh
idk
per person?
yeah
is it reduced becuase your splitting it? I assume theres a flat rate
thats not that bad, you're only paying extra for food as compared to nutford whihc isn't that bad
yeah
so we'll see  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
are there any less convienet places that are cheaper that have gone through?
?
that you've gotten contact with I mean
one wont reply to me
 :pensive_face: 
theres one for 850 per person 10 mins away from ucl near kings cross
wowow thats insane

Does this mean you think sweating would make you less tired
no these are two separate statements
Ah right
<Media omitted>
so participating in the icm for the first time
Cool!
this guy keeps posting pics of fields medalist lectures
What a flex
I had a dream that I was in an African village then it was dark and a bunch of squirrels jumped on me and they wouldn't let go of me
Scary
oh no
squirrel besties gone bad?
They were fluffy tho
So not all bad
that's good
Yioy
yioy indeed
Oh right you took a nap
Forgot about that

Ha we slept at the same time
On the other side of the world
mhm
special thanks to my inability to stay awake x
Real MVP here
Ep 22:
finished the season  :white_heart: 
Mhmm
i like the argentina bit
also holt and rosa  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why is Rosa's interaction with everyone so cute :loudly_crying_face: 
cause she's all  :black_heart:  :chains:  :skull:  but everyone loves her and then she shows emotion towards them cause she loves them back
It's so cute
i cannot believe i just said she's all and then put emojis
All my homies love Rosa
yes
Why not seems reasonable
it seems like sth my sister would do  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Seems like something your sisters sisters would do
(you)
mhm
thanks for the clarification
i thought emulen
Nws
I'm well renaound for my clarification abilities
mhm
should put it on ur linkedin
You should make a LinkedIn
To put all your cool internships on
not until i have to
Why
i scrolled through gaurav's feed
i do not want to do that
Do what
and then have to connect w ppl  :skull: 
see ppl's posts
Just don't do any of that
and long ass speeches
Just make an account then put stuff on it
You don't need to do any of the extra stuff
This is the same argument Gaurav uses for not getting Instagram
ok got it
but also i dont want to put stuff on my linkedin
Why notttt
ohh i just found out who botond major is
Interesting
Then when your admirers look you up they'll be like wow this girl has done so many cool girlboss things
I just matched his face and name
I've seen this guy so many times in lectures
I did not realise that that was Botond Major
Ok
Who is that
he's doing a  fluid mech research internship
Funded by the london maths society
and he always comes to lectures w a coffee from pret and a frown
Lmaooo
like we were trying to enter the darwin building on our first day and it wouldnt let us enter from gower street
and it was me and this other girl
and i was saying stuff talking to both of them
but he just stared and never said anything
Haha
Taste of your own medicine
and he just silently followed us
like no nod no anything
Strange
I miss you  :crying_face: 
Aw I miss you too  :loudly_crying_face: 
My brother is playing alarms very loudly
It is probably wake up time
But still
Would be real cool if he could not
My sisters have to go through this all the time  :white_heart: 
 :upside-down_face: 
yioy
I am so tired
 :crying_face: 
have you tried doing cocaine?
im never gonna stop complaining btw
no i havent
 :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Oh I sat w Ananya, Isabella and this girl called Michelle today
Isabella from Columbia
?
florida isabella?
the girl who always hung out w Nadia
oh right
is michelle new?
No
i've seen her in the quiet room a few times
yioy
Did you know that Isabella's dating a guy 7 years younger than her?
oh
I didn't know that
me neither
how old is she!?
She said her bf just finished his undergrad
So I think she's like 28?
I mean
as long as they met in uni  :woman_shrugging: 
idk where they met
Anyways
Her mum apparently told her
"get married to a rich man”
and she was saying "i am the sugar mama”
lmaooo oh no
and ofc
in my head
hahhah
Chihend chin chto nado baiya bi sugar mama
mama
the thing you do for that line every time
where you do this line
then you put your hands around your mouth for the seocnd mama
and then the mama again?
is so funny
it's iconic i'd say ngl
<Media omitted>
what is homegirl doing lmao
hey you're listening to batsaanaa
being cute and quirky
she is being very cute and quirky
I miss you
I miss you too
i'm gonna rewatch this
why do all the mongolian music videos go on other channels
also i kinda want the swiss roll
I couldn't find the big Gee music vid because of this
and this one is on B production
because they're signed to different labels
B production was started by Bold
Whose daughter I taught physics once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntt7zCAtpe8&ab_channel=BProduction
this video is scary ngl
this one bangs
you just know everyone
oh you have a tutoring folder on your computer
what tutoring ahve you done
I feel like you've never talked about it
because it's barely anything
It's just helping my friend prep for her niche entrance exam
yeah well my tutoring is also pretty close to nothing, but I have to milk it for content
And I had some pages bookmarked for that
since my life is boring  :loudly_crying_face: 
You do it like twice a week
haven't done it since last tuesdya
and when they need me its semi often, but that was only for last summer
idk if thye're gonna keep requesting me
hm i see
still
yioy
I kinda just sit down prepare resources and explain concepts
like once a month
lmaoo
its lit we take those
and I havent done it since I came here
Actually I did twice
once for khulan
once for indra
indra?
she need help with multiplication
idk I sometimes see offers to teach like small children and I'm always a bit uncomfy because when its calc or something its more just knowing and explainign the concepts but when its something like arithmatic its 100% just teaching ability not maths knoelage
Hm yeah that's true
basic algebra
it's like
1st one has 20 more apples than the 2nd one. 3rd one has the same number of apples as 1st and 2nd combined. If they have 400 apples in total how many apples does each have
oh wow
thats actually kinda hard
She is in 4th grade
I think that's ok
But she just didn't understand why I was using x, so I switched to "apples of the 2nd one” which was so long and I was trying my hardest to explain that this is just writing things down that have to be true
you just have a big variable called "apples of the 2nd one"
Yeah
I think she got it in the end
well done
But it took an hour and her hw was 5 exercises
and we only got through the first one
and I told my mum I had to do my own work
So idk if she managed to do the other ones
danke
my brother someitmes asks me for mahts help
he hasn't recently
but its always kinda nice
and then once he got a 100 on his test and he sent me a screenshot
it was cute
That's cute indeed
I think you told me about this
Cause my sister was also waiting for me to wake up so she could call me and tell me she got 100 on her test
<Media omitted>
awwwww
the way i panicked when i saw this, is not ok
????
it took me a few secs to get what was going on
what did you panic about lmao
"do i even know how to do this - oh god what if ive forgotten everything - how am i gonna do research - how is tomorrow gonna go”
pipeline
omg mish
calm yourself
yeah
its D right
seems right to me
cool cool cool cool cool
now youre gonna tell me its not
idk the answer
its totally D tho
postivie at +- infinity
negative -3,3
wait no
?
neagtive -sqrt3, sqrt3
dtiydk
oh no I'm gonna fail all my exams  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
me
 :neutral_face: 
1st year girlies were stressing about results day at the women in maths thing
i was like  :loudly_crying_face:  you're gonna be fine
really? why lol
leticia was like "im p sure i failed prob and stats”
oh no  :skull: 
nah but we'll have each other for support there, you're on your own for the rest of year 3 modules tho
wait do you share any with Jean
like 1 right?
functional analysis
prime numbers and their distribution
multivariable analysis
that's it i think
oh nvm so like al of them
half of them is shared w jean
2 each term
thats nice
I need to make some friends in my year  :skull: 
my wit and charm in the lectures halls should help with that
Yeah
or tutorials next year
Even tho tutorials in 2nd year are so utterly useless
i dont think ive ever learned anything in them
the tutorials in 1st year were also pretty useless
1st year tutorials were helpful imo
you had 1 on 1 time
and made up questions beforehand to ask  :skull: 
because he made us
he sent several reminders
and he kept telling us this is a requirememt
thats strange
but nobody else did right
indeed
you were just solo carryign the tutorials
other than that one guy
and the guy
i still havent met him in person
he seems cool
he was also in tutorials from bed
right
i know this cause i heard pillow sounds
hahah
while he was talking
does "also" mean you were as well
and he said "sorry im on my phone so i cant screenshare”
have you met your tutors? they must know you pretty well by now lmao
no
hahah what a chad
nope
jeff probably remembers me
analysis 1&2
then francis johnson doesnt know my name
algebra 1&2^
ali has no idea who i am
and
for methods i was so active but boehmer just didn't know anyone's name
he'd always say
"the person that spoke before”
or "the other person”
referring to me and baktash
lmaooo he was mostly asleep fro the tutorials as well
LMAO was your name not on zoom?
It was
But also he had zoom off
The whole time
? he had zoom off in the zoom meetings
He's like "sorry the tab's closed idk who's talking”
i think he pulled the thing into the corner or sth
idk
and then for methods 2 i had helen
who i desperately want to acknowledge my existence but i dont think she knows me
even tho i have been at all the open days and active in tutorials
oh no  :loudly_crying_face: 
and the women in maths thing
we all want helen based clout
and i said sth smart once lmao
this is a joke
is the joke that you've said more than one smart thing or you haven't said anything smart ever
with the staet your self-esteem is in recently would not be surprised by the latter
it wasnt smart
it was basically a thing where she started going through the exercise using line integrals
and i said
can we just use the fundamental theorem
and she was like oh yeah
oh right, isn't that the thing eric did
yeah
because theyre her solutions
typed up
and he did manual calculations in front of us for like 20 minutes assuming we can't do basic calculus / algebra
yes
yeah idk I liked my analysis tutor
betti I think
betti?
yeah
she's actually a physicist
theoretical physicist
and nikki and michael in term 1
they were both really nice
niki is great
but then ali eric and lars  :skull: 
i met her at the wims thing
and
did you know that ashman knows her
I didn't know that
the nutford ashman?
yes
<Media omitted>
he was telling me to reach out to her
yes
he is mega old finished undegrad in 2017
yeah he's 27
im not a fan
Why not
I've never talked to him
if it's a group conversation
he will not look at me
if it's individual he'll talk to me
by group convo i mean me + one person + ashman
Lmao
How many times did that happen
esp if that person is beatrice
fairly often
Oh got it lol
i dont think he's trying to hit on her
but it's still genuinely annoying
he helped me
so i cant say too many bad things about him
Helped with what?
and then he also tried to promote his tutoring services to me  :skull: 
he was like i can help w linear alg
Also is he doesn't seem like a maths computery guy to me
sending emails
to potential supervisors
Oh lmao
That's nice tho!!
for money
and i was like why would i pay for tutoring
and i didnt even indicate that i was struggling w anything
Yeah that's a little weird
yeah he was basically like "just send them your grades tell them why you picked them and send it off - don't worry about sounding stupid”
idk what i was even stressing about
Idk whenever I offer to help people with maths I don't ask them to go thought the website, just because it's weird and gross
True
because it was kind of just common sense stuff but i genuinely didnt know what to put in the email
like i know why i picked them
He's probably right though  :cowboy_hat_face: 
but also it sounded dumb
and also probably only if theyre like "i am struggling w maths”
i am fine
at that time at least
not fine anymore
but tutoring will not help  :skull: 
i get the concepts and everything
Yeah
 :skull:  :skull:  :skull: 
Hot take
You didn't fail anything
Therefore fine
I hope
I really hope I didnt fail anything
Im gonna be screaming crying sobbing tomorrow
 :crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
It'll be fine, trust

You're from here right?

Oh okay not that small then, I think Sunnyvale is similar size
Where do u want to go for masters again?

<Media omitted>

All my homies love Europe  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
there are three tube lines in nürnberg
i'm p sure i told you this
there's public transport everywhere in germany basically
 :flag;_Germany: 
Yeah transport was very very densely built in berlin
one of which started when i was like 8 or sth and i was not in germany
It's nice
and it has no driver
Magic
so you can be in the front or back wagon
and see it just move
like see the tracks in front
or behind you
they're like full on windows
p sure i have photos printed back home of me on this thing
DLR does that too
Right
Yoy DLR hate
I was 10 mins late to my shift at excel cause i got on the wrong dlr train
<Media omitted>
which is my fault
but also
It is a little confusing
I'll concede that
mhm
<Media omitted>
exciting
im gonna try making macarons at home
If you need any pointers let me know  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :raising_hands: 
will do
I had to separate the white from the yolk
The first one I tried just instantly collapsed
It was a bit of a disaster
lmaoo
crack the egg softly split it in two and then do a little dancy dance w the egg yolk
is my strategy
If I didn't know how to do this "a little dancy dance with the egg yolk" would be impressively useless advice
But yes
Little dancy dance
mhm
my uncle and aunt came over to my grandmas today
and they asked when i'm coming
That's fun
As in when you're coming back? Or they thought you were still in Mongolia
coming back
Right
and my mum said in august but she doesnt seem extremely eager to come home
and they were like
thats a good sign, that means she's gotten used to the environment
 :skull:  :skull:  :skull:  :skull:  :skull:  lmaooo
i was like mhm
all cause i mentioned that hearing my sisters fight in the bg of my phone call w mum was stressful alr i couldnt imagine the stress of being there
Are you not looking forward to seeing (maybe being stuck babysitting sisters) your family tho  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
I am
But like I'm not dying to see them
Is what she means
as in
not homesick
Right right
i am gonna fall asleep again soon
Goodnight  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :white_heart: 
danke
another nap from 9-10 im gonna assume
Good luck  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  not running sleep schedule that is
ruining?
good night
 :white_heart: 
Yeah
That one
Goodnight  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream:

ok so
his phd supervisor was ruth baker
i know her
because she's a tutor at the oxford college i was at
<Media omitted>
smh regret missing this graduation
she graduated today
Good for her  :partying_face: 
alexander you cannot make this up
 :upside-down_face:  how do you remember things like this
<Media omitted>
It's crazy
i was reading this post
then you sent a message saying "good for her”
Always watching
at the exact moment that i was finishing
i was obsessed w my oxf college
i know everything
i still know the guy who walked with me to the other college
even though it was a half an hour walk
he was a first year eng lit student
called daniel
and he made a detour for me to show me oxford
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
You're insane
But like in a good fun quirky way
Less than 3
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Which one was it
st hugh's college
it's the furthest up north
but 10 mins away from the maths dept
Man
I like London
I do too
But all the Oxbridge colleges have these enormous gorgeous lawns out front and pretty architecture
 :loudly_crying_face: 
St Hugh's is brown
it's p big
<Media omitted>

 :upside-down_face: 
17 yo mish
baby  :loudly_crying_face: 
i had just turned 17 as well
lmao
<Media omitted>
wait when were you there?
for interviews
2018
2018 ok
december
I was in cam 2019 jun
you were 15 in 2019 jun  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
stop please
I'm an adult  :loudly_crying_face: 
i was 17 in jun 2019 but i was about to go to uni
i know
one of the tutors fell asleep during my interview
lmaooo what
yes
your in person interview
tbf she was old
they fell asleep
yes
bro what
and the other one was interviewing
me
you were that boring? rough
she was like "i nodded off”
hahah
https://youtu.be/5VaoZ2oKYcs
^ he was interviewing me
and the question was really easy
thats insane
as in the question in the yt video
oh what
super basic optimization
yeah
so her falling asleep is justified
I could do that when I was 15 I think?
why are they asking you taht
idk
it seems weird bc they asked me quirky silly questions not like textbook maths
whatever
idk my questions were all over the place
one of them was
prove that there is no polynomial function that only produces primes
???
like the output is only prime numbers?
when integers are put into it
oh
yeah
idk how to do that
it was v difficult
contradiction?
he kept talking and talking at me
and eventually i got it
and then i immediately forgot after i left the room
one of mine was if there is a town with 365 people can there be a day where nobody has a birthday and I very confidently said no, one person on each day
 :loudly_crying_face: 
then they asked me "what is the maximum distance any two points can have if there are 5 points inside a square of length 1”
and then asked me to prove it
lmaooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
to be fair he prefaced it with something that I think was meant to trick me but still  :loudly_crying_face: 
its fine
sqrt(2)?
I think im misunderstanding the question
there are 5 points scattered inside a square w side 1
1/sqrt(2)
and i did a thing with just putting the points in arbitrary places
giving an example
and they were like thats not a proof
and then they said
oh like if you position them optimally how do you maximize the distance between the closest 2?
between the furthest two
well just put one in each corner?
nvm im stupid
closest 2
think of dividing the square
and then i was like oh
is it one on each corner and one in the middle?
yes
its lit
but when i did that
they said
thats not a proof
im going to oxford  :partying_face: 
oh
so what i did
was
 :crying_face: 
split the square into 4 smaller square
s
since we have 5 points
two points must lie within one square
then the distance between them is maximised if you put them on the diagonal
ahhhh smart
and then the one at the other college absolutely destroyed me
they did not let me talk at all
they just kept yelling at me
yelling at you  :crying_face: 
my second one was kinda funny
there were two guys
left guy started took about 10 minutes, I did okay
2nd guy was like, do you know what the bionmial distribution is
I said no lol
then they were like oh okay
and first guy went again
then 2nd guy didn't get a word in lmao
lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
poor 2nd guy
oh
right before you """"slept"""" you texted me on whatsapp
yeah
my phone was on the table and it yioy'd real hard with my mum right there
dont think she noticed tho
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
sounds enough like a normal person notification sound
yioy
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yioy

Lmao
arghya's good

Make sure you have plenty of water tomorrow, crying in addition to being emotionally exhausting is also physically tiring and dehydrated you
Cry responsibility
Thanks  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>

You're going to be fine I promise  :double_exclamation_mark: 
 :hundred_points: %
 :loudly_crying_face: 
i really really hope so
i am v terrified
If you wanna settle this argument in the ring
ok
cool
 :boxing_glove:  :boxing_glove:  :collision:  :coffin:  :skull_and_crossbones: 
(I won)
Now you'll be fine since I won
so the conclusion is
Checkmate
instead of me kms you killed me??
Hard to say for sure
But the bottom line is I won the argument
right
Ms girl
Are you okay
uhh
i'm fine?
I'm just like uh oh
is this you trying to tell me that i need to calm down
You need to calm down
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ok
ok
I'm looking for one of those jumpers with a zipper
For Gaurav
where?
Target
Not working
right
good luck?
Thanks
idk much about target but somehow i dont think you'll find anything good  :loudly_crying_face: 
I think you're right, might just get it amazoned to you
okay
<Media omitted>
hm
idk
i think neutrals might be better?
he mentioned sth like wanting a white one i think
he has red stuff but he doesnt wear that often
I'm at a thrift shop
exciting
<Media omitted>
hm
better i think but idk
the place is called
Goodwill
goodwill of silicon valley
Oh right
I forgot
of silicon valley yoy
?
i sometimes forget that silicon valley is like an actual place
?
like
it doesnt feel real to me
Oh BC all the tech guys wanna go to silicon valley
to me it was just a fantasy land where there's just a narrow street w google and apple and nerdy ppl who make bank
And I just spawned here
Cringe
<Media omitted>
ooo
white one?
but idk
<Media omitted>
maybe its too white
Baby bee
aww
<Media omitted>
hmm
ok sorry now all of a sudden i am thinking does he want long sleeves or short sleeves  :loudly_crying_face: 
Short sleeve jumper?
like a polo
cause the first time he was telling me about this
<Media omitted>
he was wearing his white collared shirt
and he was like
"like this but with a zip”
ahhhh
idk
this is stressful
and i'm not even the one buying
It's like 8$
I'll live if he hates it
okay
this is like the chris evans sweater
<Media omitted>
but w a zip
Ah right
Is this a good thing?
yes
but i dont think it's gaurav's style
or is it
idk
I think the shorts and my face throws off the fit
With slacks maybe? Idk
Hmm
I'm trying to picture Gaurav wearing it
and I think it's alright
But also Gaurav has such particular taste
I told him that I liked his fit w his jacket and he was like "I dont. I think the jacket ruins it”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  brutal
Maybe just go with white
?
Yeah
will he like the material  :loudly_crying_face: 
I hope so
ioy
yioy
I mean
Worst case, 8$ down the drain
okay
<Media omitted>
4 dollars for the dog
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
omg
nvm
just got sad because i thought of ppl dropping all of these off at the thrift store
?
 :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ms girl
In the feels
yes
 :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>

gaurav too probably if he knew
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
<Media omitted>
man
who messages the gc at 1:47 am
asking about exam results
they're just trying to stress you out
thats def jiguang on the burner acc
you're so funny sometimes
thanks  :white_heart: 
yooy
jiguang on burner account  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yeah cause who tf calls themselves "arrivals”
jiguang it would seem
lmao
sending a package is so hard
how do you do this
the post office closed at 5pm
lazy people
i dont know alexander i told you we dont have post in mongolia  :loudly_crying_face: 
right
fair enoguh
like proper post
that doesnt take 2 yrs to arrive
 :crying_face: 
I can't do this  :loudly_crying_face: 
its too adult for me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm gonna go into the post office tomorrow with my box
Did your grandpa get up ending the card?
Okay
proclaim loudly: "give this to mossy" put like 20$ on the table then leave
that should do it right?
yep
probably
sick
so
there was this guy called dualta
in the gc
and then later a girl called catherine joined our group
is this mishtal content or maths 2nd year content
mishtal content but no cute stuff
oh  :pensive_face: 
ok go ahead
and we're all friends etc right
mhm
and dualta introduces us to her
and everything
and everything's fine for a couple of weeks
then crystal and i are sherlock holmes
we realise
dang things only lasted a couple weeks
hey dualta and catherine are never online at the same time
I read that as sherlock homies
they use the exact same texting style
omg no way
yeah
this is insane
I can't believe it
so we confront dualta
I had the wool pulled over my eyes
being like
for all this time
are you catherine
and he was like
uhhh yeah
lmaooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
thats really funny  :loudly_crying_face: 
why did she do that
we called him dualtherine for the next few months
omg
i dont know
his name is dualta
as in like dual
yes
as in 2
lmaoooo
thats insane
did you not ask
why
I think we did
i think he said sth about him being the only guy and feeling left out
I can't believe the period of my life from 40 seconds ago to 20 seconds ago were all a lie
wait catherine is a guy?
dualta is catherine
which one was first
dualta
ohhh right
dualta was pretending to be catherine
so the dual thing is a conincidence
catherine is not a real person
got it
he felt left out as the only guy so decided to artifically add another girl
ok lol
idk
he wanted to be one of the girlies
ohhhh
I see
<Media omitted>
i havent seen his face since 2016 lmao
is he from london?
no
dublin
huh
theres this london girl I know that follows him
the one I have left on read for 40 weeks now
he goes to ulster uni
Oh no see this is the pipeline of ppl knowing about my insta acc
you know this girl, this girl knows dualta, i knew dualta from the internet
<Media omitted>
bsf ily
Oh my god
That is terrifying
I'm scared now
lmaooo
hahahah
thats crazy tho two degrees of seperation
some ppl from the gc applied to ucl as well
none of them got in
 :pensive_face: 
because you were applying? was gc still alive during uni apps?
not cause i was applying
they applied first actually
one of the just finished law at hong kong uni
why aren't you following him on insta?
!?
the other is doing econ and maths and uiuc
isn't that the racist one
bc i was never that close to him
uiuc?
yeah
idk
what happeend
people at the 4th of july thing were talkign about it and they said the people there aren't very pc
hmm
well they said they throw around the n word a lot
but idk
right
idk
he was in the gc
yes
how many people were in the gc
but the gc changed to so many times
counting dualipa or whatever as one
i think in total
there were at least 20 people in there
more than 20
at some point or another
this was an editing group chat?
not necessarily
just friends
but everyone made edits yeah
right, was mishtal the talk of the town there as well
as it should be
ofc
hahah
was it the account specific to mishtal had 8k followers
no
the account specific to mishtal had 100 followers but we only let ppl who knew us follow it
right
so i had 7k she had 10k
the joint acc had a bunch ?
but we made appearances
apperances lmao
on each other's accounts
all the time
as in one would log into the other one's account
or we would post about each other
?
I thought there was a joint acc that wasn't just a mishtal account?
guess not
there was but it was so brief
it was a spam account
everyone had their own editing accounts and we'd hype each other up
thats crazy
wait check @emilymaymumford
old mish would hype up everyone under the sun's edits
new mish will drop a single white heart under a post that has her in it
crazy stuff
also @liv.cowdy
any mutuals??
if yes i will cry
omg there is
is it me
do you know mishsmishaps?
 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i knew youd make this joke
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :white_heart: 
also cmbyn girl and beatrice have mutuals
as well as cmbyn girl and isabella from florida
oh no
lmaooo who
how
oh does cmbyn have hella clout
idk i'm not gonna ask either of them
yes
actually i did ask her in december when she called
and she said she knew this girl from germany
and she said
"she has a stick up her ass but in the best way possible i love her”
???
referring to beatrice?? or isabella??
no
beatrice and cmbyn girl's mutual
oh right
it's this girl from lithuania
ohhh okay
Gaurav has beef with a lithuanian girl at his internship
odds its the same person?
it is not
he showed me the picture
it is not
even tho theyre both lithuanian girls at lse lmao
right well normally I wouldn't say thats enough to assume they're the same
but how tf is joanne bessties with dual person
<Media omitted>
this girl
i dont know  :loudly_crying_face: 
whats cmbyn girls name
not pronouncable by english speakers im assuming
yes
Munguldei
pronounce please
<Media omitted>
very non pronouncable indeed
mhm
yioy
yioy?
it yioyd
because i was looking at her acc instead of being on the app
i know saulet told you this and you said you werent daft but
please dont click on her story
i think her acc is still public?
its private
oh okay
haven't requested lmao
dim*
right
is she still in paris? spamming storied
stories
austria spamming stories
is she still on the close friends
yes
you know how if you're hungry and you forget your hungry
yeah
if you eat a little bit you'll be more hungry then when you left off
like before you ate
because you remember
where is this going?
if you dont have the full beef then you're just gonna be worse off, only having half beef will just make you more metaphorically hungry
idk what hungry is analogous to
but probably something
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yooyp
Yooooooy
ok
sleep time
good night
Sleep time
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
if i havent died of shame by the next time i text u
good night  :white_heart: 
?
grades
results
Would it not be a good night if you die of shame tomorrow
Is it a goodnight now but becomes a bad night retroactively tomorrow
Or is it currently decided
In which case
I'm feeling pretty good right now
And I think you're about to have a nice sleep
So your result went fine  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Bing chilling
well if i die of shame
then it's not just good night
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yoooooy
Ms girl
ok sorry too far
but uh yeah
ok good night
 :white_heart: 
goodnight  :white_heart: 
having nightmares about this email
 :loudly_crying_face: 
various types
Multiple  :loudly_crying_face: 
and im in a pub in all of them somehow
Oh no
Foreshowding your alcohol addiction after the exams
lmaooo
(this is humour to lighten the mood not commentary on how your exams went)
i know
what happened in them
one where i got a moodle notif being like "dont be disappointed if ur results are bad”
then another one where all maths ppl were in a pub
that doesn't sound too far fetched
and this guy goes "results out in 2 mins”
 :loudly_crying_face: 
then another one where you and i had plans to look at cute doggos at the pub
then saw lecturers there
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
oh no
they're ruining the dream dogs  :crying_face: 
yeah
and a bunch of other stuff
i keep forgetting as soon as i wake up
you were waking up multiple times
miss girl
was the cute doggos dream Alex's idea
because if it was thats 4-0 for dream Alex slaying it out in dreams I think
i dont know
 :crying_face: 
im so stressed
It'll be okay  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
no but even if results aren't good, you'll be okay and results are probably better than your expecting
i am terrified of not passing. and even if i pass everything i will still be disappointed by the low scores
yooy
also
maybe should you sleep
nah im good
and you'll definitly pass thats not the main worry
that is kinda the main worry
ok for the other things I'm largely speculating but just based on how you reacted when you were less stressed and the fact that 1) you studied for all your exams adn 2) you're just a smart person you definitly didn't fail
i also studied for complex analysis  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
like a shitton
yooy
ok
i'm sorry
its okay to be stressed
but none of the exams went nearly as bad as complex analysis
methods 4  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and you passed it anyway
and also what if complex analysis went down
was better, if marginally
grades don't magically go down because people hate you ms girl
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I promise you'll be alright!!! everything will be fine smart people are fine therefore you'll be rather alright :D
thank you  :loudly_crying_face: 
real sweet
even if your grades don't mega kill it, I feel like two summer research projects about maths is a pretty big deal
3 if you count the presentation
should maybe not count the presentation tho haha
lmaoo we just got yelled at for the presentation for an hour straight
lmaoo
lmaoo
hopefully  :crossed_fingers;_light_skin_tone: 
idk I feel like showing intrest in the subject and being willing and able to do these cool optional things is a bigger statement than just being good at workign the course
and also
you haven't gotten results yet
I'm so stressed
Gaurav
its probably fine
Just said
econ ppl started getting results
 :sleepy_face: 
i dont think its fine  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I mean i'd say you know better than I do, but I think the stress might be getting to you a little, after you actually took the exams you seemed, for the most part, fine
so I think youll be fine
mostly cause i was more happy they were ove r
I mean after each one
you were never screaming crying immedietly after
methods was almost screaming crying worthy
but i didnt
now i actually feel physically sick
like throwing up sick
ms girl  :loudly_crying_face: 
what are you worried about
everything that isnt algebra 3&4, number theory
<Media omitted>
aks at it again
yoooy
 :upside-down_face: 
this is fine
im gonna die
my heart
is stressing
ms girl
wanna talk
no i'm ok
also kinda dont wanna talk
ok
blocked nose is not fun
like physically
no worries
im so stressed
also is it not 3am for you almost
are u sure youre ok
are you waiting for your results
yeah im playing with leo
who is jetlagged im assuming?
yeah
very much so
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
fuck

 :partying_face: 
thats good
<Media omitted>
omgg
this is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!

you slayyyeeedddd
what happened
you slayed out
i'm so disappointed about analysis 4 ngl
I told you so
mish please
thats so good!!!
firsts on everything except analysis 4
which is close enough to a 1st
we round it
methods 4
and obvs complex analysis
eh
we already knew that
averages to more than 70
and you were scared you were gonna fail
ridiculous behaviour
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yooy
Ok cool you're good
have you got yours?
Nope
Alright am going to sleep now, congrats on getting a first  :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Goodnight  :white_heart:

<Media omitted>

Guess so  :person_shrugging: 
good job!!
Thank you

The spacing isnt working out
lowk embarrassing
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
That worked fine
danke
did gaurav text you with his absolute king slay destruction results
yoooy
econometrics  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mhmm very king slay
indeed
he also thinks they wrote his grade wrong and that it's 48 instead of 84
You're both such silly people
i was like what are you on about  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  but then i realised i did almost the same thing yest
<Media omitted>
gonna meet dima next saturday
It's lit
also
now that you've seen your results
do you wanna sleep  :loudly_crying_face: 
3 hours of sleep  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yes
good night
 :white_heart: 
<Media omitted>
Also I sent my mum this and she was like "omg i can tell ppl you're doing medicine research”
 :woman_health_worker: 
lmao
he sent me an email asking what programming experience i have
i'm gonna tell him "i know basic python”
my mum seems rly excited about this
and she told me to buy her books w my salary
Python is really easy it's fine
???
She requested two books
for me to buy and bring home
Yeah
He asked if i know matlab and mathematica and I'm gonna tell him no
Seems reasonable
I started learning R and SQL but I have forgotten everything
Started learning
in 2029
2020
Whoops
Right
It's so weird so end an email with "I know basic python”
Best wishes,
I say Misheel
It really isn't I think you're just freaking
okay
Sent the email to my supervisor
Well done
It's a messy email
Oh well
Whoah chill Mish has arrived
Filled your quota for stressing today
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaoo
Jani asked if my exams went ok
I have yet to respond to him
Why did he do that
idk
"good"
"ok”
Hahah
since the weeks dont have to be consecutive
i'm gonna ask him if i can take the week off during which i go home
because the 8th and the 9th are just gonna be me travelling lmao
ok not the 9th
i will be dead on arrival on the 9th
Mhmm big layover
at 6am in mongolia
 :crying_face: 
How many weeks do they want you for
What have they told you
they said 6 weeks
but they said 180 hours
so 30 hours pw i'm assuming
Seems like a reasonable assumption
mhm
also they are paying me uk living wage
So 10£ an hour
9.90
yes
it's all g
Could be better but it's a lot of hours plus it's good CV value
yeah
submitting a pdf report sounds scary and i havent even started
lmaoo
I thought we filled the quota  :crying_face:  guess there's always some left in the tank for Misheel "stress Queen" Ganzorig
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo
Do you actually know what it is yet
The project?
<Media omitted>
I dont know what stochastic dynamical systems are
Idk what any of those things are
but this is v close to the research that beatriz does
But sounds cool
I think me name dropping her lead to this
lmao
Oh nice you can ask her
Yeah
Tomorrow
 :skull:  :skull: 
 :skull: 
No
Right forgot about that
Before you even ask
I have not done anything
I wasn't going to lmaoo
I am at my desk rn
i have just been sneezing all day
Oh no
Oh no indeed
I need to go get a covid test
Is sneezing a COVID thing
You know those sneezes
that are definitely I am sick sneezes
idk
Uh I'd say most non allergy sneezes fall under that category
No but like I sneeze on a regular basis right
but those are just random sneezes
Okay
And this is like a
I am sick sneeze
But this was a sick sneeze
yes
 :call_me_hand:  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  :person_surfing:  totally sick sneeze dude
i dont think it's covid but let's just make sure
reminds me of the analysis 4 lecturer
Good call
he was talking about totally bounded sets
<Media omitted>
yeah thats what he did
he was like
everytime i think of totally bounded sets i imagine a surfer dude saying "yeah its totally bounded dude”
That's funny
yeah the analysis 4 lecturer is funny
so funny that he gave me 69 in analysis
It is the funny number
ikr
Should have aimed for a 42.0 on analysis 3  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
lmaoo
Ugh I can't believe you were worried about failing
i was
i bullshitted so much on all the exams
i think they adjusted methods
How do you assess how well you did that badly
Was 70-80 expected for the ones you know went well
yeah i expected 70ish for number theory
analysis was like high 60s low 70s
algebra 3&4 was 80+ expected
i expected 50 in fluids though
Such a hater  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
lmao
well  :upside-down_face: 
it's covid
oh no
 :upside-down_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
oh nooo
gaurav is being nice but i know he's super pissed
????
nobody is pissed at you
he's always annoyed that nobody's wearing a mask  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i feel bad cause he's the only careful person around
oh right he does do that
well  :upside-down_face: 
now you can work on your paper :D
lmaooo
this is the start of the shameful texting ppl thing again
yooy
 :crying_face: 
who have you seen recently
when did you start feeling ill? little venice day
not really
but you probably wanna do at least 2 days before that
that was like a "morning and done” thing
Yest was when it got bad
Omg do I need to email Robert
I'm gonna kms
oh no  :crying_face: y
ms girl
you know what
you probably got it at the maths thing
that checks out right
Yeah
started feeling bad like 2 days after that
That is true indeed
are you alright  :pensive_face: 
I am fine
I just cannot believe this
yoy
its fine, life happens
Yooy
<Media omitted>
i knew it'd be that
nws
mhm
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yoooy
I'm just annoyed that it's covid
and I feel bad
whys that
See this is what I mean by "when good things happen bad things follow immediately after”
hahah wait yeah you're right
See I got the internship

and now covid
"ok results"
ms.girl got 20 more marks on the exams she wasn't sure baout
ok fluid mechanics was good
but analysis 4
sets it back
but you thoguht you were gonna fail methods
we take a 2:1
They adjusted it
if covid is the price we have to pay we take those
lmaoo
yooy
honestly the worst part about it isnt actually having covid it's telling ppl i have covid yooy
who do u need to tell
i told jean, ananya, gaurav beatrice
and i should probably email robert
as a responsible person
yeah, mention you think its most likely you got it at the maths thing
but you probably should let him know
Yeah
and do i have to email beatriz
did you see her in person?
postpone the thing again
i mean
No
this is a good excuse
This is true
adn you sort of weren't in a position to meet anyway  :upside-down_face: 
so this is really a blessing
we take those
this is shameful
yooy
did you have to tell anyone you were positive
other than your family
I'm gonna kms
no litteraly nobody
its lit
Because the whole group got it then you got it
I hate writing this email
its ok they wont blame you
I feel bad  :loudly_crying_face: 
Do you know the first person who got covid in mongolia
he was a french man
everyone was blaming him
it was so bad that
it took him ages to recover
ms girl
you got it at his event
if anything he should be apologizing to you
that is unconfirmed
it is most likely
There are open days in a week
If he and everyone else who's supposed to be running the open days gets covid  :skull: 
then it happens and its not your fault
you got it from someone at the maths thing
happens
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  yioy
but it could have happened to anyone
except maybe gaurab
but most people
lmao this indeed
<Media omitted>
she's on leave next week
 :crying_face: 
And when do I push in my meeting
bc I asked to start the other project on the 18th
Next week
You can do both no?
Yeah
Oh wait other project is like 4hrs a day
But I don't wanna end up pushing meetings around being like uh sorry cant do this time
That's a lot of work
Yeah
But the new project is pretty flexible
There won't be super hard meeting times right?
Probably?
Yeah
But also I dont want to push times around on my first week yk?
But it's flexible
Probably
Yeah
And they won't mind this, you're girlbossing it's fine
I can just tell her Tuesday
Because I def have a meeting on Monday
I thought she's on leave
she's on leave next week
Omg isn't this so cool
because that'd be my first day
and so I probably wont have one on Tuesday right?
Is that a fair assumption
Doing two research projects, and killed your exams
Everything coming up Mish
Except COVID
But yk what it's fine
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Yooy
You need to work hard anyway
Also Jean has volunteered to fill in for me at the open days
If I'm not negative negative by then
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Trading out girblosses
lmaoo
<Media omitted>
Is  :skull:  a stressed reaction
Yes and no
Ah right I thought it was a potential and maybe situation that really clears it up
 :raising_hands: 
No problem
I'm super helpful  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
joyce is ranting to someone on the phone
Hahah
You should go up to her tomorrow and ask if shes ok
i saw her when i was leaving nutford on an lft hunt
Jk don't go up to anyone  :fly: 
I didnt get any cause a single one costs £10
Gaurav left it in front of his door
?????
Society am I right
Yeah
I tried 3 pharmacies before giving up and texting Gaurav and Jean
Wow not gonna ask me? That's cool whatever idc
also i think people are moving in
so i'm not gonna attempt to break in
Ohhh fun
i saw two ppl ive never seen before w suitcases
New people
so
Dining room being less empty will be nice
yeah
i am gonna kms why is telling people so embarrassing
beatrice texted me saying she's negative
and then i think about the fact that i have it
and it's so embarrassing
what the hell
Nobody is mad at you
 :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
these messages were also awful to send
I had to send them to like 15 ppl
<Media omitted>
parts of my convo w yixin  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yooy
how's the poke
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  yoy
I did not know the extent of how horrible your analysis exam was, sorry about that  :loudly_crying_face: 
Poke is done
<Media omitted>
right
It's ok
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
omg you got boba
lit indeed
what flavour did your mum get
Taro something or other
got it
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  now i kinda wanna be home
out w my mum
gossiping
I don't gossip much with my mum
But yeah it's nice
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
The whole Google maps thing is gonna be real useless for the next few days
 :crying_face: 
why did it take me so long to understand that
i was like "why??? are you not going anywhere?”
real useless from your side
not mine
Mhmm
What are you going to do  :crying_face:  grind out some maths
Watch James acaster specials
 :eyes: 
probably watching stuff
i was going through r/math today
so there's this guy
christopher zeeman
<Media omitted>
 :clapping_hands;_light_skin_tone:  :clapping_hands;_light_skin_tone:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mhmm
and he started the mathematical institute at warwick
and he got 12 renowned mathematicians to join
even tho at the time warwick wasnt that great
he did it by telling all of them that the other 11 acceptes
Lmaooo what a Giga chad
That's what I did for the Mr Robinson T-shirts
I told people I'll sell for 10 $
Because if you buy 50 it's 10 per
yea
Then got 50 people to agree to that and went with it

actually kinda wanna be home now  :loudly_crying_face: 
Then again I'll be super stressed at home
I was so stressed on the call cause my sisters are just screaming in the bg
Being home will be nice
And you're stressed anywhere you go so no worries about being home  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_open_hands: 
lmaooo
you have not seen me when i'm at home
also now i'm used to living (almost) on my own
I'm excited for you to be home
so i'll be annoyed when they wake me up by jumping on me
at 7am when i slept at 3am
Mishtal content and sister content and stressed Mish but funny content
lmaoo
 :loudly_crying_face: 
its gonna be awful
It'll be fun  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Entertaining for me for sure
But probably good to see your fam
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
yeah
sisters who both have the flu vibes
Lmao what is this
Hahahah aw
there's this thing that they prescribe you
and then theres this machine
and you put the liquid in
and it vapourises
and youre supposed to breathe it in
Oh yeah you told ms
Sounds horrid
it's actually kinda good by the end
Good!? As in you enjoy the process  :cowboy_hat_face: 
<Media omitted>
yes
awwwwwhhhhhh
That's so cuteeeee
What sort of fumes is it?
idk
it feels very clean
and cooling
<Media omitted>
you switch locations so quickly
I can text and bike
you were just talking to me now you're at the library
Mhmm
Library is v close
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
this is what we were talking about!!
Yeah it is!!
Feel like this always happens
We talk about smthn then it appears
it's either
Very possibly both
I think likely both
yeah
Feel like Reddit doesn't tho? At least about stuff like limits being interchangeable
Idk maybe I'm just a Reddit sympathyser
i was going through r/math to be fair
i was looking for hot goss on the fields medalists
Haha
Find any?
I watched a video on them, just cropped up
Pretty cool, they must have mega simplified the stuff tho, they only talked about the actual maths for a little
<Media omitted>
yeah
Lmaoooo
He's a maths nerd, kinda on her  :person_shrugging: 
<Media omitted>
gonna be 24
Sick, that's old enough to get it right?
Or are we aiming for 28?
there's no lower age limit iirc
lmaoo
Misheel "Fielding medal" Ganzorig
i was just saying old enough to attend it as a volunteer :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh right
Same
 :cowboy_hat_face: 
i wanted to volunteer for this one actually
before the whole war
because they wanted russian speakers
and they said the more languages the better
and i dont need a visa to enter russia
That's so cool
Speaking 4 languages comes in handy I guess  :loudly_crying_face: 
yes
you know in mongolian we have this saying
it's actually my favourite mongolian saying
heltei bol hultei
Speak a bunch of languages for fun?
which means
if you have hel (language/tongue depending on context) then you have hul (feet/legs£
ie languages are the thing you need to get by
And you have both  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
(because you speak all the languages and have enormous calfs [presumably])
lmaooo
That is cool tho
Yeah
I'm a fan
<Media omitted>
i actually dont know the proof for that one
Oh I do!
Ok the way I know isn't super proofy
But it's like, imagine writing a decimal number for each natural number 1-1
ohh
ok
got it
Then you can make another one by taking the first digit of the first number and adding 1 to it then the second of the second number
Yeah yeah
that's cool
Still weird how the even naturals have the same size as the naturals  :woozy_face: 
Yep
That emoji looks very different
Fun
exciting
My friends don't believe me  :loudly_crying_face: 
well a decent chunk of them are gonna be math bros
so they will believe u eventually
or are math bros already
One is a computer science bro
One of them is a soon to be data science with a math inclination bro
then he will never believe u
Like data science but more math based
ok also
 :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
but not about navier stokes
i think it's about bezout's lemma or sth
Lmaoooo they know too much
Hahah
Doesnt one of our professors say this about group properties or something
idk i didnt watch any of the algebra 2 lectures
i wouldnt know
Fair enough haha
the joint that connects my foot and my ankle just cracked
amazing
???
Foot and ankle
you know what i mean  :loudly_crying_face: 
There's a joint there? I thought it kinda just becomes
I don't  :loudly_crying_face: 
Like right below the bone thing?
like
the thin thing
omg i am genuinely useless
Oh the thin thing in the back
Lmaoooo
yeah
How tf do you crack that
maybe not that
It's barely even a bone
but something connected to it
<Media omitted>
Like the back
yeah
idk you just feel it near there
Ridiculous
I'm 100% convinced you just have little bone fragments in your blood stream
From cracking so much
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
ok
sleep time
Sleep time
good night  :white_heart: 
Goodnight :white_heart:  hope you feel better soon !
danke  :white_heart: 
That wasn't funny  :crying_face:

He's so sweet  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
How are you feeling
Good mou
I'm okay
I wish I'd slept more though
But I'm kinda awake now so  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
You can just go back to sleep
I hear Joyce's friend coughing next door
like a persistent cough
Oh no
They got your COVID  :crying_face: 
she was coughing before that
Like I first heard her coughing before I started sneezing
cause I was thinking
Ooh that sounds nasty
is it covid?
^ is what i was thinking
Oh maybe you got it from her  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
through the walls
lmaoo
Mhmm
Thin walls
Lmaoo
just got an email
from the airline
gave me a heart attack
they said my flight time had been changed
so i thought id be missing my connection
no theyre just changing the time for when i leave mongolia
and arrive at the same time cause theyre flying over russia instead of doing a detour
<Media omitted>
sorry one second
dont apologise
good idea
counter idea
ill do what I want
so sorry !!!
that is
therefore, sorry
not very sorry
though I am very sorry, of my own volition
when you come back in september?
can I call
gotchu
give me 5 mins
yes
ok
<Media omitted>

<Media omitted>
Omg that's so cute
Inspiring the next generation you are
<Media omitted>
the paper is 99% biology btw
Oh no
<Media omitted>
Did they tell you to read this
yes
 :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
They know you don't know bio right
They know I'm a full time maths student
Maths with nothing but maths
Maths with maths
It's ok they mostly have explanations for their biology-y terms
some of them don't
but this girlie didnt do a level bio for nothing
even tho she remembers nothing
Can you really make sense of this
Oh right you did
I remember macrophages and monocytes being a thing
 :nail_polish: 
Sick that makes one of us
<Media omitted>
i was such a try hard at a level
Ms girl
and this is only the stuff that i scanned and sent to one of my friends
How does one make sense of this
i had this memorised in my head for the exam
Right of course
Silly me thinking the paper was actually used for something, just remember everything
some people made mind maps, some people made notes, i needed this combo to make sense of it
map notes?
Map notes  :loudly_crying_face:  how did you do 5 a levels
no social life  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
We did you decide to do 5 a levels
Me neither and I pretended to be a normal person academically anyway
I did 4 at first without further maths
then i asked my maths teacher if i could take further maths even if i had to self study
and she was like sure i'll teach you further maths
and at that point i didnt wanna drop anything
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Fair enough  :person_shrugging: 
<Media omitted>
more notes that i distributed to ppl
Omg my notes have never been anything more than pen on paper, occasionally a diagram
But in hs I didn't even take notes
I just remembered things
i gave cmbyn girl all my booklets for her last year of sch
she gave them back
after the year was done and told me i saved her life
lmao
Like straight up, didn't have any notes for any classes, only expedition was psych because I self studies
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
that wouldve been impossible for me
Mish solo carrying
and she said that other ppl asked if they could use it and she said no bc i told her never to let anyone touch them  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo
Lmaooo what
The holy Bible for passing all the a levels
i was being overdramatic when i told her not to let anyone touch it
ready for your meeting? :D
Would have been passed around a lot otherwise tho it'll be like the fountain of youth, everyone trying to get to the notes
I'm not sure, depends on what they're expecting of me
I'm emotionally prepared, whether I'm quantumly prepared is another question
Not too much I'm assuming
You're a 1st year
 :loudly_crying_face: 
being emotionally prepared is all you need imo
I'm a first year who said I have all week to read then didn't  :loudly_crying_face: 
being quantumly prepared means you're both prepared and not prepared?
sorry that was a rly low quality joke
I can appreciate low quality jokes
danke

He's just existing this time
Yes
But he's everywhere
"at it again" makes it sound like he's doing something to you  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
existing again
He's everywhere lmao
The audacity of this man to exist in *your* presence
Not cool, have some manners
lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Jiguang just stresses me out
I mean
It would be rude to but be stressed with how much effort he's putting in
also it's weird calling him Jiguang instead of Jiguang Yu
Not be stressed*
Mhm  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's the Alexander Yule incident
it is
But to me, I feel like there are different times calling for different ways to say your name
No I do not know how to distinguish them
? Huh
You sometimes type Alexander out
as in
it's either
And I feel like I'm being told off
alex, alexander and alexander yule
lmao  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :upside-down_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i did not mean to sound like i was telling you off
Okay yk what I went through them and it's not really like that
It's kind of like, a be serious thing
is it?

You mentioned
But Im done now
It was really expensive  :smiling_face_with_tear:

Def thinking of something before I leave next year
Nobody else has a summer birthday right
indeed
Who's gonna be in London  :loudly_crying_face: 
Gaurav's staying right
You're leaving  :loudly_crying_face: 
I mean yes
But who's gonna be in London to give it to him
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
You could do what Ethan did
Give it early and make him wait a month lmaoo
Gaurav has it in his room and was like "how am i gonna stop myself from opening it for a month”
Omg I realised I'm gonna be so stressed
Your birthday is 11 days after I come back from Mongolia
Ok this is the last time I'll mention your birthday around you because otherwise it's too close
Hahah
Okay
Doesn't this just mean I get a cool Mongolian present
It's lit
I also need to figure out details of where I'm gonna take him
Probably
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
Yeah probably smart
I am so exhausted

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
thats a lot
It is
But what I've read so far seems cool, even though I don't totally understand
So it's lit
not totallt understanding is fine
How about totally not understanding
That might be a bit bad
But you'll get there right
Probably
we take a probably
that's good!
we do indeed take a probably
are you mocking me
no
maybe the exclamation mark was a bit extra
but you cant blame me ive had to send several things w exclamation marks recently
so exclamation marks are kinda in my brain yk
haha, ok I thought you were mimicking my thats good!
whats with all the exclimation marks?
I have covid !!! :D
no as in
thank you!!
mostly
to internships
and get well soon wishes
internship *s*  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i mean internship related emails
Okay fair enough, lots to be happy about  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :cowboy_hat_face: 
indeed
they keep playing this sound outside
it sounds like the beginning of the fire alarm
and then stop
and everytime it gives me a heart attack
Oh no
Not again
This happened in term 1 no?
no its not like that
How many times has it happened
it happens once every 10 mins or sth
And how many more times are you planning on being surprised by it
and lasts for like 3 seconds
how long has it been going on for
like 20 mins
it had happened twice
so
twice?
oh okay
Yes
okay then its reasonable the be scared by that, i revoke my previous mockery
thanks
v appreciated
nws
better?
is it yioying
Yea
And i need to turn it down slightly
As I'm in the library  :face_with_head-bandage: 
was about to check
Lmaooo alexander  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: , lmaoo, yoy is high praise for one of my bits
Not to be confused with one of my qubits
mhm
<Media omitted>
if i kms I won't need to understnad what this means
problem solved
yoy
the geometric interpretation is too hard  :loudly_crying_face: 
what is going on
its a matrix that represnts a qubit gate
okay
so normie cringe computers have things like not
quantum computers have this hellscape
they don't normally use this formula
but still  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
are all of these angles im assuming ??
must do
that is v complicated
it is
<Media omitted>
idk just take it at face value
oh i sitll have no idea what the sphere is for
each slice of the x-y plane represents the same probability distribution for the qubit
right
I have noidea why we need a sphere
why is there complex probability  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
I get that this is 50/50 and you just absolute value it
but why do we need to be comlpex about things
this should be an email to my supervisor I think
i'm reading about the bloch sphere
oh ok
new supervisor  :slightly_smiling_face: 
ok in conclusion i dont get it
oh okay sick
i got to that conclusion as well
<Media omitted>
glad we agree
honestly i'd take most of it and just accept it
for now
ask later
yeah thats what I've been doing
the bloch spheres aren't actually that bad I have the idea
its just really really hard to geometrically interpret it
in any amount of time that isnt' like 20 minutes
for like each problem
yeah
can imagine
<Media omitted>
and if you have r = 1 all the time then its a sphere
r = 1 all the time bc probability should add up to 1
i just dont know why alpha and beta are allowed to be complex
yeah
 :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
or she be graduating
bby  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
We have already seen that qubits are a system with discrete outputs 0 and 1, and yet can exist in states that can only be described by continuous parameters. This is a particular instance of the well-known notion of 'wave-particle' duality that is typical of quantum systems
Yo this is sick
sorry Im throwing quantum physics at you while your sick and its midnight
but its cool :)
No it's fine
It is sick indeed
have you figured out why you need 4 real numbers to describe them
ie 2 complex numbers one for each 0 and 1?
yeah thats what I assume
you need two reals for each complex
everything ive read so far has been dealing with single qubits
yeah but why do you need them
not even gates between two of them
why not just yolo with 2 reals
to do cool quantum stuff
what's the 2d aspect
I don't knowww  :loudly_crying_face: 
and be kinda continuous
yk
it might have somethigin to do with polarization
right
ive explained bb84 to you right
you probably have but i mightve forgotten that it was called bb84
you have
yeah
i looked it up i remember u telling me about this
Yeah so probably that rotation is relevant for representing qubits in 3d
But idk
that makes sense
No it doesn't  :loudly_crying_face: 
But the annoying but is they didn't mention any of this stuff
They just kinda threw complex probability at me
And called it a day
right
i googled complex probability and exotic probability popped up
Is that's something even more complicated or just a quirky adjective
idk i didnt read it
my phone is doing a weird thing where the volume goes up and down
actually it doesnt
like the physical volume just goes up and down
Are you covering the speaker
no
and it goes louder at random times
That's fun
i know right
Add a bit of excitement to the phone usage
ayaya
Ayayoi
indeed
i looked at my screentime
this is genuinely disturbing

i will never sit on the rollercoaster
it got stuck once
during the loop
i was terrified
to hear that
Oh my god
That's terrifying
Like upside down?
yes
??????
That's so scary
I didn't need to know rhat
yes
and it was relatively newly built
the roller coaster i mean
i showed you the pedaling thinng right
on the thin rails
Oh yeah that
thats also terrifying
for different reasons
its so squeaky
and you think the whole thing's gonna fall over at any minute
Yeah I'm not sure about the amusement park ngl
Just from those things you've said
some bits are fun
you just need to know which ones to avoid
Rest of country seems kinda lit tho  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
I hear Joyce coughing in her room
does not sound pleasant
You have her covid thought the walls
lmao
yooy
having covid is so embarrassing
you know i had to tell beatriz i caught covid during december
cause she gave me a bunch of work
and i told her i had covid
speaking of beatriz she gave me more work
lmaoo
yooy
She did? I thought it was a summer project  :exclamation_question_mark: 
and linus said to read the paper
yeah
she was just like
just read this and this stuff
cause i had a meeting w her during january
but it wasnt official official
Right just for fun
Like early
so she just said if you read anything during the term just email me w questions
yeah not like ian telling jean a bunch of stuff
i told you about linus emailing me right
i now have to say linus
and beatriz
instead of my supervisor
cause i have 2
flex?
He gave me a choice of programming in mathematica or python
The original paper that he gave me
had code written using mathematica
? The new person?
 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
yes
Which one u gonna do
and he was like "since you dont know mathematica i'll give you two options - learn mathematica and then use their code but slightly modified OR code it from scratch in python” then he was like "i think the latter will be a better learning experience” and i dont think i'll need mathematica in my life later on so i picked python
Hmm
That's probably good
Python is v easy
Yeah
But this is more work right
Yeah
And now you won't know mathematica
I'm fine w not knowing mathematica
Which might b more helpful for, you know, mathematics
it's a very applied maths thing to do
it's very numerical
Oh right
Cringe!!
I'm ok w using python
Wait so you're redoing the whole thing when people normally just work on it a little
nono
not normally
he said
"we're looking to produce similar results to paper x”
and paper x has code
so he was like you can do mathematica or python
Also paper x is gonna be the death of me
You have to do a whole bio paper?
Can I call u in like 10?
yes
but audio
Ok
uhh kind of
i'm waiting for him to tell me more tbh
Sorry give me a bit
okay

 :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:

Forgot to ask how you're feeling!
Physically, still emotionally devestated from the tiktok
And rude comments
yes
Physically I'm okay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sneezing occasionally
we take that as a win
Okay, glad to hear it  :white_heart: 
 :white_heart: 
<Media omitted>
good job
<Media omitted>
idk what he actually does
i was like 1 minute into this video then i stopped
he was the one person i didnt predict
I was told you got all of them
Misheel "misinformation" Ganzorig  :unamused_face: 
No
Jean said I guessed 3/4
I guessed 3 ppl in total
so all of my guesses were correct
technically
and i said idk about the 4th one
Righhtttt
Misheel "misdirection" Ganzorig  :unamused_face: 
???
how is that misdirection
I thought you got them all and you didn't read my mind and correct me for misinterpreting what you said  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
To quote Jean: "improve yourself"
can't believe this  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
yoy

Why do you have auto caps off
You'd think you of all people would be fussy over grammar
Given the incident
but im not trying over text
the incident was started by her
Would you let an inappropriate "and I" slip into text conversation?
no but for that i dont need autocaps
 :person_shrugging: 
<Media omitted>
 :pleading_face:  :pleading_face: 
<Media omitted>
Tiktok is onto you
oh yeah it did that when you sent me sth
being like
Oh but also same
double suicide?
Oh no
Lmaoi
When I was 15? I tried to talk a girl I knew out of suicide
Worked tho  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
good job
then there was this finnish girl that crystal was besties with before she met me
her name was anna
Haha stole her away
and she said she'd cut herself if she didn't get enough attention
then sent pictures of cuts
that were from google btw
Oh my god
That's terrible
yeah it was awful
then she came back after crystal and i were besties
and she called me a pokemon lmao
Oh what? That's disgusting as well
Different reasons
Crystal took her back?
no
the gc did
She should have standards after being "besties" with you
Ok good
crystal was p against it
and then i talked to one of my other friends
who's 4 years older
and i still talk to occasionally
she said she also knew this girl
and she pretended to have ear cancer
and also sent cut pictures from google
?????
Is this a common thing for her
At 13???
idk
Omg
yeah
insane girlie  :upside-down_face: 
crystal was v emotionally unstable when this girl returned
and we distanced ourselves from the gc
after that
Mhmm
Understandable
Poor crystal  :crying_face: 
then the girl left and we rejoined
Good  :face_with_steam_from_nose: 
there were so many silly little fights
in the gc
GC must be infinitely better without emotionally manipulator girl and with mishtal
and we were laughing about it like a year ago
and i said sth like "oh we fought about so many dumb things”
and crystal was like "remember anna”
and i was like "except for anna”
The GC would fight or you two would fight
gc would fight
What's anna
anna's the name of the finnish girl
Who crystal talked to?
yes
Sorry I'm having a hard time keeping track of ppl
anna used to be in the gc
before i joined
and crystal and anna were besties
then the whole anna fake cutting thing happened and anna left
i joined the gc days later
and then anna rejoined at some point
we left
anna leave
s
we rejoin
Oh right sorry
last year crystal was like
Didn't realize Anna was the one doing all this
talking about how we fought
we as in the gc
and i was like "yeah it was about dumb shit too that didnt matter at all”
and then she was like
"remember anna”
and i was like
except for anna
Yeah that stuff is really bad
Are you going to talk to your sister about being safe online
yeah
the thing is telling her not to is not gonna do anything  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
She'll be okay she has a ex chronically online big sister who will help her
Yeah I mean
I doubt lecturing will do anything
But just like the internet is dangerous and you should come to me if anything is dodgy
and fanpages are a slippery slide
Or maybe she needs to be a bit more mature for that idk
the thing is at that age you dont realise its dodgy
i would have never come to anyone w that
bc then they wouldve told me to cut contact
which tbh i would tell my sister now
Yeah that'd fair
do you see the problem here
Yeah
But I feel like as her sister instead of mother
She might be more willing
Esp because you did the same thing
the things that i would have wanted to hear and the only things that wouldve made me come to someone are things that as an adult i could never tell a child yk?
like "oh it's gonna be fine you just keep comforting them and bla bla”
i cant say that now
hopefully
but somehow doubt it
?
what was that
<Media omitted>
Am bike
such an emotional roller coaster
today
i have been up and down in 30 minute intervals
what is going on
BANGER
<Media omitted>
so ive come to the conclusion
the only way to stop this emotional rollercoaster is to press "not interested” everytime a couple thing pops up
Oh okay
Nws I'll send you stuff  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
#1 a level
lmaoo
Hahah
Emotional rollercoaster sounds fun
Boring otherwise I'd say
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
not if it's up and down in 30 min intervals
Wdym more fun that way
Unless the rollercoaster stalls upside down  :smiling_face_with_tear: 
lmaooo
So I'm watching this German show and it's this really bad comedy about this guy who's about to become CEO after being a tech bro and he's looking for his USB stick for some presentation. Then his nephew who's currently living with him suggests looking for it in his laundry and the guy goes "i would never leave it in the laundry” but it is in the laundry.
Which made me think of you putting your airpods in the laundry  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  I don't need this
Oh wait
<Media omitted>
But they don't need to know that
rightt
I got a blister from rock climbing that opened
Oh no
It hurts
Yikes
Wanna see
mayhaps
<Media omitted>
ouch
that looks painful
Yeah it is
Only when I'm grabbing things tho
It's fine otherwise
okay
did you clean it
Uh
I don't want to  :crying_face: 
It'll hurt
you're not supposed to use rubbing alcohol
just use warm water and soap
it'll be fine
Oh okay
Soap?
probably something not scented
Why can't my wound smell good?
and then keep put a band aid on or sth
i cant tell if you're doing this as a bit
<Media omitted>
scented stuff is more likely to irritate it
<Media omitted>
ok good
<Media omitted>
Is that now?
brown st at night
yes
Why's it so bright?
How are you doing
it's not as bright
as it is in the photo
Right
but unless you have night mode on you cant see anything
but it's p close i'd say
Oh night mode  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  all my homies love night mode
<Media omitted>
(We all look insane and blurry)
<Media omitted>
Lmaooooo
egg mish
Egg  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I am doing ok
Ok?
Yeah
Everything okay
Yes
no worries  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Okay
I have just had a roller coaster of a day despite doing nothing which was exhausting
But I'm practically done w covid symptoms except fatigue  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Yayy :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Yay! Fatigue and headache  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm gonna do a test on Monday and hope to god it's negative
I dont believe in god

Emotions are hard  :grinning_face_with_sweat:

Lmaoo
i had 2 strikes of "holy shit i am girlbossing smart” and 2 strikes of "holy fuck i am so dumb it is unbelievable”
and then the whole tiktok recommending me couples stuff
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  too much
these tiktok couples are my mishtal
as in
Was I'm so dumb induced by cut the rope
mishtal to you
Tiktok couples get me too tho  :loudly_crying_face: 
Actually 3 of them
Lmaoooo ms.girl

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm actually gonna cry
I just saw a Reddit text to speech video about this wife
I actually started tearing up a little
dating apps sound horrid and meeting people organically is hard
oh no alex  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I think I started crying to one of the videos you sent me
I chose to not send it because you were already in the feels
I said I was gonna cry
and it sounded like I was joking
but I was crying
No
One of the time you said youre gonna cry
Idk you say that a lot
But that one I felt
Let me find it
Was it the bird one
yes
it was the bird
omg
That was so sad
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
im gonna cry again
Noooo
This isn't helping
But she goes there with the cherry
Then she comes again with a worm
They're not there either time  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  she was hopeful  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I know
It's so sad
@happylilly64:"I wanted to be a mom a little longer”…  :pleading_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  I'm gonna cry actually

I'm so tired
It's unreal
I woke up like 3 times
You just woke up
Oh no
I woke up at like 3-4am cause M texted me and it was really loud
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Then it was way too hot at 5am
What was so important
So I got up to open the window

She has a really bad sleep schedule
<Media omitted>
Also bad mental health
Oh no  :crying_face:  I hope she's alright I quite liked her when she visited
She liked you too
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I think she's okay ..? She usually disappears from social media when she's not good but I know that she atleast has her flatmate w her  this time
See like this kind of disappearing is fine
Oh well, if she has people there for her she'll be okay hopefully
But cmbyn girl was thriving and ghosting
Mhmm
Thriving and ghosting
yeah
It's so hot
This is illegal
Yooy
Did you manage to get back to sleep after waking up
It is hot here as well
Barely
Then outlook rang
It was Robert
Please
Because I scheduled an email yesterday
Are you checking outlook emails at 4am
With my timesheet
no at 8am
and he asked me how i was feeling
Wait did you do the thing where you schedule an email to send at a certain time
yeah
When did you have it for
And why  :loudly_crying_face: 
cmbyn girl is flying back to mongolia today
8am
Good for her (?)
Because I didnt want to send him an email on Sunday
 :flag;_Mongolia:  def in my top 200 countries list

Also I was watching this documentary while making it
About this girl
Who wants to be a pro ballerina

What if I had stuck to ballet
And then I thought "I probably wouldnt be inflexible”
Yeah probably
And her dance teacher was Russian

Oh no
My bad  :grinning_face_with_sweat: 
Not your fault
I woke you up because it wasn't minty  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo no
You asked me if I was up
and I was half awake
and I was just turning
So I was fully awake after that
It was a nice nap though
Sorry  :skull: 
Stop apologising
It's fine
Will just sleep earlier

Oh no
That's devestating
Ikr
I'm having lunch rn
Tty in a bit

 :soft_ice_cream:  :cold_face: 
Bing chilling indeed
What have you been up to
I watched 1 ep of b99
I was thinking of starting superstore
Yeah go for it
It's pretty good
B99 is better tho
<Media omitted>
peach??
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mhmm
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
my classmate is posting stories from chinatown
The guy that is in London
Right
I am still gonna not say anything
Yeah I mean if someone I went to school with but didn't know was in London I wouldn't say anything
We didnt know each other enough to hang out
So it's fair actually
If it's someone I've talked to a few times then maybe
But probably not
Did I tell you
So I think you're being fair
I taught him maths
at some point
Oh
I was feeling v ill
Professor Mish
 :skull: 
This is how the story starts
Oh no
And my maths teacher was not at school
And so instead of doing maths I was just laying with my head down on the desk
and he walks in from the other classroom
and asks if I can explain sth to him
Oh no
And I was so tired and ill
You're dead on the desk and he asks specifically you for help
I was alone in the classroom
and he went to find me to ask me for help
Oh okay fair enough
I dont think I was visibly ill
Ah right the legend of the math goddess moss
Actually I was on my period and just semi dead
So when he came in
 :crying_face: 
He was like
can you help
im like sighing
<Media omitted>
more cause of the pain
not because of him
but he clearly thinks its cause of him
<Media omitted>
and he's like
if you dont want to help that's okay
 :smiling_face_with_tear: 
I'm like no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And I explain it to him
 :loudly_crying_face:  you can never be like "if you don't want to help that's okay"
I am half dead throughout me explaining
Nobody is allowed to say no to that
And I keep on sighing
And clearly being
not alive
and then he awkwardly thanks me and leaves
lmaoo
Lmaooo oh no
Then you continue being dead
 :crying_face: 
Yeah
It's fine
But it was an unfortunate time to ask lmao
Do you know any other people from school who went abroad
To not Turkey
A lot
Let me think of countries
USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Poland
Australiap
Wow that's insane
How do the people know the languages
For most of them they dont
So they go to unis where they teach in english
Oh places do that? Thats cool
But I know that the people in South Korea, Japan, Russia and Poland
had to learn those languages
So the girl I know who studies in Korea
she learnt Korean from watching kdramas
Hahaha
That's one way to do it I guess
The girl who's in Japan first learned it by watching subbed anime
That's how she learned English as well btw
She learned from reading subs
Hahah
Learn English from watching subbed Mongolian shows then Japanese from subbed Japanese shows
That's kinda lit
No I mean
Does she speak a 4th just for fun?
She learned English from reading subbed animes
Like
She had basic skills
Oh right
There are no English subs for Mongolian things
That's not true
She was at the Russian school w me
So
Russian
and also she speaks a bit of korean as well i think
 :loudly_crying_face:  it's not fair
I know 1.5
The people in Poland
Are scholarship holders
But they make you go to a 1 year intensive language course
before you can start
Eeesh
but it's all expenses paid so its ok
Oh okay it's lit
Thats fun
Speed run learning a language
Munkhjin actually got that polish scholarship
She was almost gonna go
She also had the Hungarian scholarship
She's just getting all the scholarships
Yeah
Wanna watch some b99
Sure
Cool
<Media omitted>
im a fan of the eyeliner
also the expression
i guess im also just a fan
no closet, no drafts, no calf, no instagram, no Taylor Swift karaoke, no personal statement, no youtube

3/4 of them are actually some of my favourites
Alexander
I'm watching the first episode of superstore
and the lady who asks for laxatives vs stool softeners
she's the one who films holt and jake in coral palms
Actress overlap!!
I did not realise I had a grad shift allocated to me yesterday
I forgot to cancel on them
I need to cancel on my grad shift tomorrow
even though I totally could pull up
and its only from 10.30 till like 2pm
but i dont want to
so
<Media omitted>
Will do
Oh cool! I saw a super store actress in b99 once
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  nice
Hahaha really the entire thing though
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
What are you up to today
I have been dealing w the lemmas that Beatriz gave me
Tutoring at 2 beach at 3 I think
How's it going
fun and exciting
Did you take another covid test
Yes
It's negative
Yayyyyy
i am dying in the heat
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Did you get some celebration bing chilling tho
No
I haven't left
I'm gonna leave tomorrow
Why
idk
safety
Okay
Ok-ish?
idk I feel like I'm bullshitting everything
How so?
Just doing random things
That are not totally rigorous
I think they could work  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
That's how it be  :person_shrugging: 
As long as you have the right train of thought
Win in my book
indeed
<Media omitted>
it's so weird
i am getting mongolia content
from cmbyn girl
Why's that weird
Shes in Mongolia
not used to that
Did she not post on her story before her trip
i have no idea why its weird
nope
Is it because she disappeared off social media
Ye

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Senior citizens
I'm gonna make a sandwich then b99?
Okay!!
yes!!
Omg
What happend to the old mish
What did you do to hwry
Her
b99 happened
Okay!! ???
let a girl be excited  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Haha ok gain enough
I'm vey happy for a girl to be excited
I'm surprised for this girl to express it over text
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
okay
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Gorg  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
some kids are throwing their toys out of the window
????
Revolution
<Media omitted>
Lmaooo what
Were you just staring out the window
No
the toys thudding is so loud
I was checking out what was going on
??? You can hear it from your room?
I see the kids who are throwing them out
Yeah
My goodness
The people in that apartment complex can too
They're there with their heads out the window
telling them to stop
Hahah what
That's dramatic
The kids are just laughing
Lmao what
the guy directly below them is screaming "hey” at them
They keep throwing all their toys out
What the hell man  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Someone needs to come get their kids lmao
Also did you know that toy story traumatised me
I didnt watch the whole thing
Okay I hear the mum screaming at them
The mum is screaming her lungs out
oh my god
?????
Lmaoooo
God I havent heard that type of screaming
since I left home
and when Indra punched Emulen
I think
That's justification for mega screaming?
I punched my brother all the time
Ok but your brother wasnt extremely tiny in comparison to you
And this was for no particular reason
Right fair enough
She just wasnt doing what she wanted her to
One Indra punch is enough to fold emulen
The mum is screaming
her lungs out
Omg
I can hear her from my room
That's genuienly impressive
<Media omitted>
you have to hold it to your ear
i just heard her scream "next time nothing for you”
I never watched the whole thing
But
The fact that toys had feelings was genuinely terrifying
I did not want any of my toys to feel sad
like
not just the animal/human like ones
arbitrary things like
sand moulds
So I nearly cried when we forgot to collect one of them from the sandbox in the og squirrel house
cause I was sure by the time we came back it'd be gone
it was there
Ok sorry
Gone on another random irrelevant story there
Omg she's really going at them
Awwww
Lmaoooo
Baby Mish crying about her toy's feelings  :loudly_crying_face: 
indeed
Totally relevant stpry
so them throwing their toys out the window hurts my feelings lmao
Ok
Have fun tutoring
Thank you  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Lmao the mum was like is it okay if we go over an hour
And I was like sure BC it pays me however much we do without rounding to an hour or anything
Yeah
This guy shows up 10 minutes late, disconnects twice for like 2-3 minutes so we're only working for like 15 minutes total
Then that's it
But whatever
lmaoo ?? ok
only 15 minutes??p
Yeah
what did you get done in 15 minutes?
I put it as 2-230
girlie's confused
He had like 5 homework questions he was stuck on
right
<Media omitted>
i am still v proud of this
i was going through the photos i sent to my mum trying to find sth
and this popped up
That was so girlboss actually
I was mega panicking
Omh
<Media omitted>
I was calling Gaurav earlier and my mum came in and she was like happy birthday soon!!!
I'm gonna kms
Because I told her about the package
So she knows
So unsubtle
this wasnt what i was looking for
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh No
But
I mean
Gaurav knows that you know that it's his birthday soon
And Gaurav knows that you got him a present
just not what  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
So nothing much has been revealed
Yeah fair enough
Still embarazzing tho
True
Hahahh I remember this
V cute
<Media omitted>
I sent this to my mum
And she said "that voice is so awful”
Lmaoooo
That's so targeted
Completely ignoring the claims
I know
But it's true
I'm the least favourite but also I'm her bestie so  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
It's because she sees you more as an equal than as a child now so she likes your sisters more as children but you as a person
Agreed!!!
Your sisters definitely haven't been around since you were still a child!! Agreed!!!!!
Dw you're my favourite out of your mum's children
lmaooo
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
yeah she definitely likes me as a person
she's like "we raised you right”
Awwh
and then she's like "what are we doing wrong w those two”
That's sweet
Lmaooo  :skull: 
because they are entitled
and spoiled
and whenever they do sth like that she goes
you were raised correctly
Hahah why are they the favourite then
I'm def my mum's favourite
We all know it
Indra is the favourite
Emulen is just too cute
Emulen is really funny
My mum gasped and was about to go on a tsk tsk rant when Emulen got 60 on her test
and Emulen was like "I got more than half - I did really well”
Lmaoooo
Honestly
I'm taking a 2:1 at this point
Slay mindset
Ik that's not how it works there but still
My mum was like "remember what emulen said” when i was talking about analysis 4
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh wait
Nvm
Don't remember what emulen said when talking about analysis 3
Lmaoooo  :skull: 
My mum spoils me too much I feel
And I told her that
And she was like "nah it's ok”
she's like "need to spoil you while you're still in mongolia”  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Aww  :loudly_crying_face: 
Back home soon  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Indeed
Being home will be nice, being away from London is what isn't
I knowww  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Actually babysitting sisters 24/7 isn't terrific either but  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging: 
At least they're cute  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Omg you are not ready for calls with me when I'm at home
I so am
I will be screaming
every 3 mins
omg
it is genuinely awful
Screaming not necessarily because I'm angry but because they are so loud
^ sometimes because they're being irrational
Hahah
I'm so looking forward to learning Mongolian words for "stop it"
Me cooking is also so stressful
Or whatever you're gonna say to them
You definitely will
What else do you tell at them
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Johnny has another girl over?!
player? ??
LMAOOO
Your language is so funny!
Ikr ?! She brought flowers for my mum
She did????
Idk how he knows her
Omg Johnny  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
What
She brought flowers for your mum????
What is going on
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
It's not in a cute context  :skull: 
<Media omitted>
Lmaoooo that last one
Lmaoooo
ok but you know me alex
"gossip hungry” as gaurav says
Mhmm
wtf is going on w johnny???
Idk
Just a friend probably
I'm incredibly uninterested
 :skull: 
She said long time no see
Oh
Okay
So I'm assuming they're just friends from school and he's just seeing her because he's away at band 24/7
Hmm I see
Okay
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Idk you're smart figure it out
The girl is just Johnny's friend from homestead marching band
Oh ok
My mum really likes her, she's sweet she said
Yeah seems that way
If she's bringing her flowers  :loudly_crying_face: 
There's this girl who I used to be fairly close with
But we kinda stopped talking after we finished school
But I am on her close friends story
and she posts cute gf content on there  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And like
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  not on insta too
she and her gf have like such a cute down low thing
Like
They have their ship name as a highlight
and it's really subtle
because the ship name is not clearly a ship name
and most of the things are close friends stories
so only the people on the close friends story would know
and they have matching profile pictures
which is line art
 :loudly_crying_face: 
of a picture of them together
i think they're holding hands
and her gf always gets her flowers
the matching profile pictures noooo
so she just posts pictures of said flowers on her account
and on the priv story
it's gf content
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
its just all the apps out for you
not even safe on cutthe rope
I KNOW
I'm gonna kms
I want cute ice cream dates and cute lineart and cute paragraphs and to be called "my love”  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  one day ms girl
if i dont kms till then
ok sorry too much

It's yioying
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
lmaoo
Will do  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
still feeling a little death  :confounded_face:  I tried to take a covid test and the device broke, *twice*
maybe watching mongolian rap videos, nene looks really cute in Haluun Maruujin
<Media omitted>
oh no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
feel better
Good idea
lmao
sorry
that was kinda useless
Woke up just in time to not get breakfast  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
haluun maruujin
means
hot ice cream
I appreciate the sentiment  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh it's lit
also ice cream was misspelt
because she's quirky like that
also not even misspelt
she uses the russian word for it
Quirky and not like the other girls  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
?? What
and then misspells it
She should have used the mandarin word for it  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
there's a lot of words that come from russian
and then people use the russian word
but not the mongolian word
like "skirt”
But they're very close so it's sort of like misspelling
idk what the mongolian word
for skirt is
and everyone uses the russian word for skirt
AND you can't ride horses? What's going on here
like in stores
and people talking in general
our mongolian teacher told us once
everyone was shook
but ice cream is one of the words where the russian word is rarely used
But she's just
Quirky like that
this is an ad for ice cream
the whole song
is an ad for ice cream
she even mentions the brand of this ice cream
she's an ambassador for this brand
Lmao
Didn't the big gee video get sponsored by a gas station
yes
Strange brand deals going on her
Here

Goodnight  :white_heart: 
So I went to UCL to print shit
And
I left my ID
but mish is smart
so mish goes to the econ department
and then painstakingly types in her username and password on the printer
Mish thinks "Ha i'm a genius”
Nooo
Turns out Mish is extremely djmb
The printer is out of ink
and prints
Lmaoooo
That's unfortunate
20 blank pages
I'm gonna kms
Omg no way
You can put it back in the printer
You're not gonna run out of pages are you
They reset next year anyway right
yeah
Yeah so bing chilling
yes
But also
this is so stupid  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
omg
 :loudly_crying_face:  very silly the printer didn't tell you it's out of ink before printing
"""printing"""
i knoww
I'm gonna kms
I didnt wake you up did I
 :crying_face: 
Hard to say for sure in today's economy yk?
The 3rd person bit was really funny
I know
Mish agrees
too much?
No
It's cute
Okay
the question is
where should I go now
Found another printer?
No
 :crying_face: 
At least not one where I dont have to tap my ID card to get in
Ugh
Ioe? Surely there's one there
ohh
omg you are a genius
but also there's a bunch of grads rn
but i'm walking back
I would say you could ask one of the security people to just let you in and show then a picture of your id card, but I'm not sure seeing your id card would convince them you're a student here
Yeah they're extra annoyed
Okay
I think my sit in the park and read plan has been overthrown anyways
 :crying_face: 
I'm gonna go walk around
Who doesn't like a bit of walking
ikr
Have a good walk
thanks
How are you feeling?
Okay
Not great but ok
Okay
That's an improvement !!
Right?
Mhmm
drink tea
rest
my mum would say take vitamin d and vitamin c
but idk if you have that
probably do
since you're home
and your mum is asian
Seems like the sort of thing my mum would have
Hahaha
Yeah
okay
i'll ttyl  :white_heart: 
Ttyl  :white_heart:

Lmaoooo
Ishu sounds a little like mish
Hani  to crystal is a bit of a stretch
But I'm gonna assume the book is based on your story
lmaoo
i read the description
<Media omitted>
not it
Okay
At least inspired by mishtal then
Sounds cute tho
it does
How was your walk
yoy
got tired halfway through
 :loudly_crying_face: 
so i didnt walk back
Don't tell me your massive calfs atrophied in the 5 days you had COVID  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
took the  :face_vomiting: central line :face_vomiting: 
<Media omitted>
i think this is an ok distance to get tired at
Yeah that's a lot of walking
That's rough
Surely you weren't at a Lizzie line station
I was at a Lizzie line station
??????
And you chose to take the central line to marble arch instead of Lizzie to Paddington
I'm not sure we can be friends after that I'm ngl
I was considering Lizzie to Paddington
But then I was like
You could walk through little Venice  :loudly_crying_face: 
And it's the Lizzie line
What if it charges more even though you said it only charges more if you go to heathrow
It doesn't  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Probably
ok it does not
Big regrets now
As long as you see the wrong in your ways  :relieved_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:

she wanted me to bring her stuff
tbh why does she need rem beauty  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
but anyways
im emotionally damaged :/
lmaooo
your sister is so funny
lmao
maybe shes like
you
dress up in her room when shes bored yk
lmaoo
my mum told me she's been wearing the same shirt for 2 weeks now
aka the shirt that i left at home
it's a harry potter t shirt
aww she misses you that much  :loudly_crying_face: 
it's from the same place as 9 3/4
no
she started wearing it as soon as i left
she's like
this is comfu
oh lmao
and yk what my mum said
she was like
come back so she can at least wear the 9 3/4 one
and i'm like ??? we skipped many steps here why would i give her the 9 3/4 one
lmaoooo
she really wants the shirts
the shirt does look comfy tho
no that's what my mum said
you were wearing it for a while while you were quarantining
my mum told me to come back so she doesnt wear the same shirt for ages
can I have the shirt :D
because i had to do laundry but couldnt
Fair enough
It's a nice shirt
My package should arrive in not too long
<Media omitted>
yay
Saulet didn't put room number and she put her name on the package
Awe
I'm gonna wait for the nice receptionist
to get her package
Your sisters are so cute
Is that necessary
he's the least likely to throw a fuss
I put your name on it
no i meant
for saulets package
yours is gonna be fine
because it has saulets name on it and no room number
Oh right, is Saulets her name?
yes
She could have made it a gifts
Oh wait does Amazon charge more for that?
Seems like they would
Really sticking to the evil company motif
idk
Oh well
Are you gonna have to provide screenshots
Wait
Will they even keep it? BC she's not a resident
Surely
I mean they will
They're not gonna check immediately when theyre delivering it
if she's a resident or not
Do they not?
They wait a little before actually letting you have your package lol
???
Because they check the name then match it to the room
ok
anyways
Actually that'll probably make it easier for you to get it
worst case scenario
it will be fine
Wow
okay
That's a good scenario
actual sleep time
The worst is fine
What's the best case
it will be fine
Huh
Not a great range
mhm
That's fine tho
yeah
Ok actually goodnight  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
okay
good night  :white_heart:  :white_heart:

 :face_screaming_in_fear:  yoy
i do not have make up that's that expensive
shes 10  :loudly_crying_face: 
i use 2€ eyeshadow and 2€ lipstick
you're so nice to your sisters  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
put up with them and cook for them and buy them nice things
i know
yet they still call me awful  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
they'll appreciate you once they grow up
hopefully
lmao
they definitely will
omg i cant even go and buy these
oh no
i have to order it online
shipping  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmao that sort of defeats the point
i mean not really
you cant order thinfs online
in mongoli
a
cause no shipping
right
no shipping  :partying_face: 
that means you don't have to pay for shipping  :partying_face: 
lmaoo
that's why my sister said buy it two hours before i leave
lmaooo
my flight leaves at 7am i dont think thats gonna happen
doesn't it only open like the day you leave
its in selfridges from the 8th of august
yes
are you gonna be able to get it
no
oh no
i can order it online
and pay for shipping
is it on amazon?
the things i do for this child  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
you can order it on her website
you're such a sweetie
omg using other websites to buy things, really going the distance
yoy
i am not getting her anything else though
£17 lip gloss ????
+ shipping
as in
ah right thats her UK gift
i still think thats insanity
because you had to justify getting a gift for emulen to her  :loudly_crying_face: 
it really is
my mascara was £10
i think that's the most expensive thing i have
oh fnacy smanshy
still wouldn't put it on me >:(
and then said you couldn't tell when I did it myself >:(
i told you to put it on yourself
after a few coats i could
:(
then I smudged it on myself

good morning
Good morning
How was the flat
declined
 :crying_face: 
By you or them
by me
the small bedroom is too small
there's no space for a desk ??
??
like we're students
Have you seen those crazy small rooms
how can we not have space for a desk
and space for a double bed
those beds were ridiculously huge
Where its like a nook in a corridor for just a bed
<Media omitted>
yoy
<Media omitted>
i liked the kitchen
but like
no
That's a really small desk in this room too
:/
i know right??
and no living room
saulet and i were saying
turn the big bedroom into a bedroom/living room
but that's not even possible
Wow it must be genuinely tiny
yeah
like i'm picky about desk space in the student centre
how's this gonna work
Wait really, the desks are always big enough on campus
student centre no
Especially when comparing to home desks
1-19 torrington place  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
torrington has good desk space
so does sci lib
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
main library is okay
cruciform has good desk space
ioe does too
Omg just make a tier list already
lmaoo
Did you go to the Mongolian restaurant
i did not
i ended up talking to saulet while sitting in the refectory
Oh I really wanna see you make a b99 episode tier list since you'll just talk about each one like forever
OMG
yes
im so down
then i went to an agent that yiannis used
I don't think I know enough to contribute but you can refresh my memory on them
Mhm
to get his amazing tavistock place
To take his place?
yes
gave them my details
no
just bc they found him good stuff
Oh I see
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ok but
Did the agent have anything useful
if i do this at some point
then i'm gonna be monologuing
no
he said he'd ring me
 :crying_face: 
if anything came up
for like 3 hours straight
Mhmm
Sounds good
the agency or b99
B99
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Have you been papering
no
i've been so useless
Oh I checked on where you were at 1:47, too late to conclude if you went to the restaurant or not
Just Nutford
Happens  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
indeed
Wanna work on papers together
Like just call and then do work
okay
Cool
But like in a bit
yeah
i'm out
Ohhh where are you going
im at boots
just to grab necessary stuff
Like
marshmallow body wash
soap
also i tried a body mist on and now i smell like bathroom  :upside-down_face: 
Marshmallow body wash  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Like a clean bathroom tho (hopefully)
yeah
Also haha mist
lmaoo
That's (one of) your names now
Fish!!

<Media omitted>
That's very cute
i talked to my dad for half an hour
Mhmm
he asked me if im gonna apply for oxford next year
lmaoo
no
Are you gonna apply anywhere not Germany
mayhaps
idk
It's so much work  :crying_face: 
If you just walk in they probably won't stop you
That sounds like a good plan
lmaoo
he's like youve been in contact w munguldei right
no  :upside-down_face: 
 :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face: 
Did she come to hang out often?
No
She's been at ours twice and one time there was nobody home
the other time only my sisters were there
??? So why
isk
idk
How does he even know who she is
Strange
But also the fact he asked specifically this is kinda funny
he met her at the scholarship award
Ah right
for the british school
But before you started at the British school
Lmao
hm?
i barely knew her before i started there tbh
Yeah your dad talked to an aquantiance of yours like 4 years ago
And is now asking if you're keeping in touch
i mean
i think ive mentioned her
like
im going out to meet her
and stuff like that
Okay fair enough
<Media omitted>
i feel like it's ok to ignore this email
Yes
Glad you checked in tho
Before either responding and being silly or not responding and stressing for the next 20 hours
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i was stressing for 3 hours though
Omg  :loudly_crying_face:

But you are so silly sometimes
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Lmaoooo
But being subtle about it?
you two used to do a lot of studying together right??
^^ we did not

study together
Lmaoooo where did all this come from
you two were really good friends right
his tone changed
Good friend  :winking_face:

Just standing ominously
Yes
Haha sounds good
ok its fine now
walking again
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
<Media omitted>
Birds of some sort  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
i think its a type of goose
:)
its so hit
hot
I tried to go into torrington place
it's locked
omg i am so sick of my id card never working anywhere
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I appreciate it though
Like I tried to go in the torrington gates and
It didnt let me in
The security was like just go
Then the study space was locked
Bro what
<Media omitted>
Lmao Why'd he let you in
torrington lift
idk
Oh big bag
Saulet's bag that she left behind
lmao
Very nice fit
danke
Right lmao
How was the paper
Still doing it
Yoy
Yoy
I am in the cruciform no eating area and I am eating
And these girls just stared at me and left
Ok I'm p much done  :partying_face: 
Yooy
nvm
 :star-struck: 
Lmao  :sad_but_relieved_face: 
Lmaoooo slay
I left anyways
Cause there's a bit
Which I think either a) my supervisor overlooked
because i'm defo sure the thing that i did was right
But there's a small bit missing
i proved that F^5 has a fixed point
Yeah it's your supervisor that's wrong not you
just need to prove that it isnt the same as the fixed point of F
I didnt mean it like that  :loudly_crying_face: 
So I need to do that and then it's def complete
Nice  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  well done
And to do that I need to prove that there are not infinitely many fixed points
sometimes she just makes me assume things in the end and it might be one of those
bc this seems unlikely
and that's not even the condition
Why don't you just prove this
you need to prove that there are not infinitely many that are arbitrarily close to a certain point
we're not given the function
it's an arbitrary function
Oh
That makes it harder
I'm trying to imagine it and it just isnt working out in my head
Actually
I think I've got it
Omg
I'm walking
and figured it out
You're only given info about a few points but you need to prove it's not fixed nearby?
It's lit
Do tell
a function has a point w period 5
and another function is v close to said function
if you imagine the graph of both of these functions
and y=x
you realise that if you have infinitely many points then you need to keep crossing y=x
Uhhhh
and that doesn't make sense in terms of having a periodic point of period 5
infinitely many fixed points
at the fixed points the graph intersects y=x
Fixed points have to cross y=X?
yes
because f(x)=x
Right, but what about period 5 fixed points
Or are fixed points only when it's period 1
fixed points only when its period 1
Ok
if you have a fixed point of f^5 then it's either a fixed point of f or a periodic point w period 5 of f
Wait really?
yes
Just for this function? Or always
always
Isn't that wacky
cause f^5(x)=x
so either f(x)=x
or f^5(x)=x for the first time after applying f 5 times
because 5 is prime
if it was 6
then it would be
either x has period 1, 2, 3 or 6
Wait
It's is f⁵(X) the function to the 5th power or the function applied 5 times
applied 5 times
Ohhhhh okay yeah that makes sense
Got it got it
That's cool
And so you need to prove that there isn't infinitely many fixed points (period 1) to show the period 5 is a legit period 5 and u do this by saying the graph isn't y = x
?
Kind of
so if there's infinitely many fixed points around it then it needs to keep crossing it
so oscillating around y=x somewhere
Mhmm
but it's also v close to said function which has a fixed point of period 5
so if you formalise that
it should give some type of contradiction
i need to think more about it
but i think thats the general idea
Why can't the period 5 point also be chilling near y=x
Yeah that's what I need to figure out
But I think this is the correct way to fo
Me too!
Danke
at gongcha and they dont have pearls
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
????  :loudly_crying_face: 
Also I need to stop spending money
That's like
But I wanted sth cold
And I said it was ok
Their whole thing
I know right??
While you were explaining maths to me were you just standing in the middle of Gower Street
tcr
<Media omitted>
Idk the street names lmao
lmaoo
tottenham court road
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh I knew that  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Just couldn't tell by looking at maps
So I guessed one of the UCL streets
ah ok
<Media omitted>
are you guys still on call?
Yep
add me back?
<Media omitted>
also
it's kinda late ish
So i think we'll have to do everything all at once later
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Fun  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Sorry
Oh yeah ofc
Yeah yeah no worries
okay
What is this
It's a crossword type of thing
chalkdust magazine
stole one from the open day
Ohhh chalkdust fun
aka asked robert "is it ok if i take one”
Lmaoooo ofc you did
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
who is in london
He's here for a while dang
yeah till the end of august
Oh what
Does he have an internship or something
is this kensington gardens?
I have no idea
idk
Distinctly possible
<Media omitted>
Sorry I had to leave so abruptly
don't worry
Sort of sorry for sprining all this on you, take as much time as you need to figure it out
This feels to sombre for what happened
Okay :)
lmaoo
Leo's driving
This is worrying
Oh
He doesn't have his driver's license right?
Or does he
He does
Daniel is the driver
most of the time
But hes never drove more than 10 minutes he said  :loudly_crying_face: 
Is he gonna drive for more than 10 mins?
Ye
It's an hour away  :loudly_crying_face: 
it's ok i'll track you
Ok maybe not for the whole hour
But
If you die then you'll be in one place
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and that probably wont be inside a restaurant
soo
Okay sorry if I die
Yeah you'd actually have to be sorry for that
Springing all of this on me and then dying??!
Yeah that'd be rude
Emotional damage 100
Lmaooo unenessesary
Spelling is hard  :crying_face: 
mhm
I have more questions
Go ahead
But I feel like those are better on call haha
Ok
one was
You can wait for call too
But that's v late  :loudly_crying_face: 
And I have a meeting
Right  :crying_face: 
Up to you  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Is this why you asked me what my parents would think of a foreign boyfriend  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  lmaooo
No
But it was in my mind  :loudly_crying_face: 
Fair
When you're on call for 4 hours a day things come up  :person_shrugging: 
I genuinely thought you didn't when Huaiyi said we have chemistry and you said all your homies hate chemistry
Because I was thinking hmm maybe before then and then as soon as you said "all my homies hate chemistry” i was like nvm
that was just my distain for the subject
 :loudly_crying_face:  kms
Sorry lmao
It's okay
I was also v careful w the Jake and Amy references  :loudly_crying_face: 
omg
It stayed on sent for a while
and I thought you'd actually died
instead of delivered
Lmao sorry
Yeahhhh because you say I'm like Jake all the time and you're like Amy
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And like, that entirely independent from anything else
I was trying not to say that I'm like Amy too often
But I really am an Amy
Yeah I noticed this actually lmao
Suspiciously infrequently
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  omg
Indeed
Only suspiciously infrequently because I was overthinking everything
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yooy
Oh wait I totally lied I was stressed about this the other day too
Sorry lmao, it wasn't the whole time but like I'd be tired and just chilling on call and I'd sort of think about that stuff and feel a bit "ugh life is too hard"
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
tbf it is complicated yoy
also I have no concept of distance
when you've moved a bit on google maps
idk how much you've actually moved
It's very far, suburbia is wack
I'm moving more than the diameter of London
Mhm
I keep having to adjust my zoom
also your battery is v low
?
As in
Zoom on google maps
Not zoom the meeting app
Yeah  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ohhh lmao
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
are you gonna cross uc berkeley?
Maybe? It's in Berkeley
Great China is the restaurant
<Media omitted>
Mhmm
1%
yooy
there also may or may not have been a reason why i stopped myself from bro-ing you the other day
 :loudly_crying_face:  that's cute
Then you had to take my harrasment for that
i am kms
 :loudly_crying_face: 
not because of this
but in general
yooy
ok
not your fault at all
but in general
girlie's confused
you gotta let her have that
Yeah emotions are difficult agreed
agreed
Girlie can have that
mhm
on another note
i feel so bad for one of the kids on the mongolian imo team
<Media omitted>
everyone got a medal except for dalaitseren  :loudly_crying_face: 
Poor guy  :loudly_crying_face: 
and people are writing in the maths group "the first 5 have practicallt no difference in attainment - they're amazing”
 :skull:  brutal
i know
do you not have your power bank or sth with you
My dad prob foes
Was a bit preoccupied before I left
i wonder why
sorry  :loudly_crying_face: 
i feel like i do not get to make fun of you bc that was v sweet earlier  :loudly_crying_face: 
even though i'm not making fun of you
butlike
you know what i mean  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmao it's okay
okay
still
sorry
also
girlie should go to sleep now
girlie's got a meeting at 10am  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh no
My phone is about to die too
So
Oh no
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
good night  :white_heart: 
But also
I feel bad
I told you all the brutal ways I dealt w guys liking me  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That's not what made me nervous lmao
(all the ways being 3 ways)
I know
Omg
Also when you went "should i message nika”
I was like
back to being nvm after being fairly convinced
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That was enough to unconvince you
Yeah
platonic and romantic feelings are difficult to distinguish
esp for me
It was just BC I don't want it to be mega awk if there is a fencing hangout
cough cough mishtal cough
Lmaoooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
but it was right after a bunch of couple tiktoks
and emo hours
tbf that's been alwaysp
for the past few days
Yeah that's 24/7
Ok I'm at place now
So I'll probably have to ttyl
Okay
Sorry  :crying_face: 
it's okay
I should probably sleep too
Yooy
Goodnight!  :white_heart: 
Good night  :white_heart: 
I'll talk to you tomorrow  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
i cant sleep

good night  :white_heart: 
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
did you ever tell anyone before you told me?
I told Daniel vaguely
B?
Yeah
He kind of convinced me to tell you
oh wow
and then you convinced saulet to text comp sci dude
Because I was very unsure what the response was gonna be, then I started listing the stuff we do outloud and it kinda made me realize
You deleted this message
Kms
_maybe not bestie behaviour_
That was her mum
But also you
I was trying to before
the fact that you made fun of me for not realising maybe not bestie behaviour w crystal  :loudly_crying_face: 
Her mum was the deciding factor
Hahaha fair enough
But this is me recognizing on your behalf
If that makes sense
okay
yeah that makes sense
also
sorry the response wasnt ideal
Ms girl  :loudly_crying_face:  no way you're apologizing for that
also sorry for being quiet for so long
if i'd told someone and they were quiet for that long i wouldve died
kms
Emotions are very very tough, genuinely take as much time as you need. I'd 100% rather you make a decision you're comfortable and happy with over anything else
thank you alex
I threw a lot at you, it's okay to contemplate haha
Thank you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Not sure for what yet, I'll clue you in as soon as I figure it out
okay
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
?
yoy
it's a lot
as in
not just you
but internships
and heatwaves
And me  :upside-down_face:  I picked the best time
Kinda thought you didn't have enough on your plate
Make it a bit more interesting
Lmaoo
Complete the trifecta you know
Physical stress, mental stress, emotional stress
Yeah exactly
Okay I am genuinely kind of sorry this isn't at the best time, but it's kind of no time is a good time for more problems and another big reason is if I sit on my feelings much longer they'll only get worse
no don't worry
It's okay
I get it
You don't have to be sorry
So sorry there's everything right now but it's kinda how it be
It is kinda how it be
Yeah
It's okay
Don't worry
I was gonna say "According to my good bad theory something bad should happen next so at least you didn't tell me during that”
But then I feel like speaking it into the universe that something bad is gonna happen is not good
I see Huaiyi
He was right  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaoooo
even though
he was dead wrong about gaurav and ananya
Broken Amy is right twice a day
Huaiyi's not a broken amy  :loudly_crying_face: 
You just did tho, I think the universe can read texts
I thought we established that I'm Amy
Yeah that's why I said I was gonna say
But then I didnt actually say it as a thing on its own
You're Amy Indeed
So I feel like that's less
Mhmmmm
Chemistry  :crying_face: 
sounds like an in disbelief mhmmmm
Sounds like you're reading it as a disbelief mhmmm
It also sounds like you're right but that's besides the point
okay
 :loudly_crying_face: 
see if this situation had happened to me w anyone but you i would come to you and do the half crying sound that i do when you send me couple tiktoks
but then again
? I don't get it
it wouldnt have happened w anyone but you
We don't know that, maybe other people are down bad for you
but i'm not confused about liking other people
Ah right
So you would have been like why do people I don't like keep falling for me  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yes
Such a struggle
lmaoo
but it is a struggle if nobody you like ever likes you back
and then random ppl you dont care about like you
Yeah that would suck  :crying_face: 
Maybe try singing take me to church less?
lmaooo
Omg
Omg what?
Despite everything I still need to make fun of you
It is my duty
Oh no
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
So while i was talking about the logarithm graph for your crushes
The whole time I'm subtlety like
To myself
Lmaoooo
Hopefully not tho  :upside-down_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I was kinda thinking about that too
I was like
no way alex is worse than yixin
it's ok outlier
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Outlier lmaoooo
indeed
This is reassuring yourself that your trend of crushes will be curving down
Yippee  :grinning_face: 
What
You're like it's okay this is an outlier the trend will hold  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face:  :relieved_face: 
I feel like I should have more emotions and thoughts, but I've done so much thinking beforehand idk where I should be mentally
This doesn't warrant a response I'm just thinking outloud
It's okay
I've been thinking
and I was like
I should probably figure this out soon
By soon I meant before september lmaoo
Lmaoooo
Now I think I'll have to figure it out sooner
"how about right now instead"
yw
august 31st? how does that sound
jk
Haha that's still before September
mhm
also idk why but i find this
this
funny
uhh we're on call 24/7
we text each other good night
every night
and every morning
/evening
you read me fairytales
we send each other couple tiktoks nonstop
Uhh
Yeah
Ok
bad time to go
But I need to go
good night  :white_heart: 
Sorry I passed out with my phone in my hand  :loudly_crying_face: 
Goodnight  :white_heart:  I'll talk to you tomorrow
lmao
my supervisor had a fire alarm go off
and our meeting got cut short
so i'm meeting him again in 40 mins
Lmaoooo
I am kms
Eduroam cut out
2 mins into my meeting
Omg what
Like all of nutford
And so I used data to join the call on my phone
It's really the world againt moss today
And then the data cut out
Like 10 mins in
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Can I call you
Yes

did you ever do that one thing you were explaining to me over the phone
i did not#
oops
yoy
you know some emotional bombs were dropped on me remember
you did it right aftyer I woke up too  :loudly_crying_face:  I was 75% asleep and then you explained mega smart mish maths to me  :loudly_crying_face: 
oh right
very rude of whoever to do that to you
lmaoo
aya
"emotional bombs were dropped on me" lmaoo
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
brains not working
i know how to do it
but just not how to write it down
the heat is killing me
is it a quiet room moment?
that has AC right?
Mayhaps
But also I am just not up to it
quiet room or maths
mainly bc typing on the keyboard is tiring
maths
or more particularly latex
The thing is
I dont not wanna do it
But I just genuinely cant
Like atm it's fun
 :loudly_crying_face: 
its it a bing chilling then I call you once you get back moment then?
Yes
okay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I got another couple tiktok
Automatic instict was to send it to you but then I remembered
I said I wouldnt do that
 :loudly_crying_face:  lmaooo
I'm gonna fall apart
yoy
If im being totally honest
I think I might prefer it if you didn't do that
whats up  :crying_face: 
I'm just tired
and hate the heat
Nothing more
dwdw

You rolled off the bed in your dream?
Surely

waved back
It's lit
lit indeed
face id isn't recognising my face as a face
which is v annoying
it's not even saying incorrect face or whatever
it's just pretending there's no face in the frame
 :pensive_face: 
Is it piss dark?
i checked the lighting
and it's good
Rip what's wrong with your face
In a normal way yk
idk
Unlucky

Morning
Oh no
Did I wake you up?
You only slept like 4 hours  :loudly_crying_face: 
Depends on how grossed out you're willing to be
I am willing to be grossed out
I was mostly asleep then I heard a yioy and immediately got up and found my phone to talk to you
Awwww  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Omg

"heard a yioy” kms
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Are you off to campus? How was your meeting
My meeting was fine
It was 1h30mins
I was dying cause of the heat
Oh goodness
She said congrats on the internship
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
she said it's ok if I stopped working on her project
I told her I still wanna keep doing it but reduce workload
And she said to email her when I think I'd be able to get through the next chunk
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
and she said she liked talking about maths w me  :loudly_crying_face: 
Aw that's very chill that's good
Awwwww  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  that's so sweet
See I wanna be off to campus

 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face: 
and I should go to dinner and talk to Gaurav
Because I havent seen him since Sunday?
he texted me
Mhmm
Maybe quiet room then?
and you know how he's worried about ppl liking him more
sorry
him liking ppl more
People liking him less than he does
Yeah yeah
and I feel like recently he's been initiating more
Conversation with you?
yeah
or just planning in general
like he was like
we should do sth
To be fair you both sort of have a lot on your plate(s)
Yeah
Are you eating food at any point maybe

 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

This is all so much I sort of can't believe it
sorry i made u think i had almost no feelings for like the first 24 hrs
It's okay  :grinning_face_with_sweat:  you didn't really do that you just didn't say much of anything so I sort of assumed you were being flustery
Which is reasonable I'd think
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Also i'm still dying bc of the
"did you figure out what you want” bit
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  that was really bold
but im so  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
But like, that's sort of the point
<Media omitted>

<Media omitted>
listening to the cutesy crushy playlist on the way

Also I told Gaurav I'm dealing with stuff so I could talk to you (you totally count as stuff so this is legal) so uh, make sure you line up with that
Okay

next one is signal by badmomzjay
aka shake dein ass girl
Lmaoooo
and it's not too cutesy crushy
but it's still cute
I can imagine
Shake dein ass girl lmaooo
signal is basically about pretending to have no signal to spend time w each other and avoid other ppl

Good morning  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Okay
Are you gonna wake up for breakfast
mayhaps
Okay
Sleep well, I'll call you at 915 if you're not up
Kinda wanted to sleep till 9.15 so you'd call
But Indra called and yelled at me
yoy
I can just call you anyway?
yeah
i cant believe that huaiyi was right
I can
hm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Despite my dislike for chemist
Im rather glad he was right
lmaoo
indeed
<Media omitted>
darlings
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
got breakfast
sitting alone at breakfast
but
Well done  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
i would call you but then we'd be too obviously cheesy
That'd be fun
I could say cute stuff and you'd have to like contain yourself
That'd be funny I think
lmaoo
don't tease me too soon
Wdym too soon
Teasing you is like, 50% of what I do
but like
not like this  :loudly_crying_face: 
Okay, you're safe for now
okay
I think it would be really funny if we told Saulet
We shouldnt till we figure out what the hell we're doing
But
it would be really funny
Yeah it really would
Mhmm
Also
She applied to the student hall that Addie's staying in
I'm gonna apply as well
Hmm okay
They take like 2-3 weeks to respond
Is that in Camden?
It's next to Regents
15 min walk
yeah at the edge
That's not too far
to nutford
not ucl
But, Nutford ?! Maybe
I got that
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
it's kinda cute
how before if i considered distance
it would have clearly been to ucl
now it's clear that it's 15 mins to nutford
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  Awwwww
Yeah
I didn't even think about UCL
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But on that note, it's also pretty close to UCL
looking like this rn
How much is it
235pw
Awww  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
not catered
That's not bad right
but thats the same as a nutford room
Yeah
and closer to ucl
so ig its fair?
also close to lidl
and we'd have a flat kitchen
But, further from Nutford house
wouldnt that be cute
 :loudly_crying_face: 
talking in terms of transport price to ucl
or to nutford
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
? Sorry what
As in
It's 15 mins to nutford
15 mins to ucl
I doubt i'll take the bus for that
Mhmm right
you know?
Im not convinced this is better than 0 minutes from Nutford and 30 from UCL
(this is being at Nutford)  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But also
Saulet asked about the waitlist
<Media omitted>
Yeah they don't have one right? I asked a while back
Sept 1st??
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
That's so late
Tbh I got nutford on the 4th last year
Yeah it really is
But like
But like
But like
But like
This is a lot of risk yk
Mmm
How long would it take to find a flat that isn't useless
also i feel like i will be a part-time resident at nutford anyways
yk
a lot of ppl there that i like
some that i like a lot
Because you have a month if you get rejected to find somewhere before school starts
Omg
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
v long in sept
<Media omitted>
Omg you're recording an audio
I cant listen to this in the dining hall
Yes you can
Quiet and next to ear
Yeah okay I mean, im being optimistic, probably no Nutford next year  :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face:  :sad_but_relieved_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  that makes two of us
Gaurav messaged me half an hour ago and I just didnt see the notification cause I was too busy staring at you
I feel bad  :loudly_crying_face: 
like this actually kills me
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
i feel like such a child but it's so flustering and i am just gonna die of it
like it's sooooo
I dont know
At dinner sorry

Good night  :white_heart: 
Goodnight :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Too busy starting at me I can't  :loudly_crying_face: 
I am really down bad for you
It's slightly concerning
 :loudly_crying_face:  you really are
You wrote a 3 message thread about how you're flustered by this
I am kms
This is so embarrassing
But I don't think it's concerning, it's really really cute
I miss you
I miss you too  :white_heart: 
I'm so
Yooy

I'm gonna die
No dying please
Okay
Only cause you asked

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

When you say yoooy
Its another one of those "wow this is actually really the person I was crushing on forever liking me" moments
Like
The yoy girl is down bad for me
It's very  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
on tiktok i always see "she fell first, he fell harder” tropes but i think it's "he fell first, she fell harder”
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And I'm pretty down bad so this is v impressive
I know right
Told you I am super affectionate when down bad  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
As in I would rarely show it if I didnt want the other person to know
But now since I can just let loose  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
The dam has been broken
Mhm
If you don't want yourself to know either  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah
I'm actually gonna die
I cant be normal around you
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
At least you have a couple months to acclimate
That is true
I genuinely cannot anymore
That was so difficult earlier and I had a couple of mishaps  :loudly_crying_face: 
mishsmishaps
Hhahah
That was so difficult  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  lmaoo
Ok this is gen embarrassing
But like heart rate went up a couple of times
Yeah I know  :loudly_crying_face:  I need to wait for you to stop honeymooning so hard so we can watch the next ep of b99
But honestly
I'm really enjoying the honeymooning
You're such a cutie :loudly_crying_face:

WHY IS JIGUANG YU
SITTING NEXT TO ME
Fudge and why on earth does he know Ian
Why does he know that
Ian went to Princeton for his bacholers
Stayed at eth Zurich before he came here to UCL
and jiguang even said "he's good'
I asked him why do you know him
he was like I know him well
This is the funniest thing to ever happen
He didn't tell his name
But his name tag flashed in front of me
JIGUANG YU
Jean is the 2nd funniest person on earth
After you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Lmaoooooo
Awww  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
The way she told the story
Even over text lmaooooo
Yeah
She's so funny
The name tag
JI GUANGYU
And ofc he knows Ian petrow
If this was in person she would make dramatic hand movements
How does he know Ian and not know Beatriz

Just had a girly chat w Jean
Amongst other things she said
"You have two Alexs: one you hate, one you love”
She asked about Gaurav
And when I said that he's probably not a fan she was like "why do you think so”
so I was like "I think he's just upset we didn't tell him earlier”
and then she said
"I'm looking forward to seeing you guys on Friday”
"it's going to be so entertaining”
She also said
"I have a dutch man called Kloosterman I'm obsessed with and you have Alex you're obsessed with”
^ lowkey true
So I told her it's been 10 days but technically not 10 days cause I waited for a while to say yes and she was like "wow you're playing with alex's heart”  :loudly_crying_face:

Lmaoooo
Good night honey  :white_heart: 
Also
Post nut clarity
Even tho
no nut
but
ok anyways
It is really stupid to be on camera and be sexual
Now panicking about viruses
also babe
make sure your friends don't see our messages x  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
It's okay
don't want them to know what we've been up to xoxo
There's no way that's a problem, your computer is probably safe
Oh but maybe
Maybe?
It's not impossible
But unlikely especially since you're safe
LMAOOO
Yep got it  :skull: 
No way we had actual phone sex before holding hands
I'm gonna kms
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaoo
whoops
Yeah oops indeed  :loudly_crying_face: 
Rice purity score went down by 1  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Checking boxes off together
We're counting that as sexually explicit
Yeah I think so
Yeah
Even if no content was shown on camera
I think
it counts
Content on camera
Lmao
 :loudly_crying_face: 
this is so funny
i blame distance
round 2's gonna have to be with my mic though
i am not doing that this loudly again  :skull: 
Check #30
Oooh
sorry  :loudly_crying_face: 
ok
actually sleeping now
i say sorry meanwhile i actually said "lowkey enjoying the fact that you have to be normal around your friends now”
Night darling  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Goodnight  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
how was being normal going

I'll be out for a bit, sorry darling

But also, maybe some more sleep is in order?
Like anyway

Like 130?
1.30?
Yeah I'm kinda down for round 2
Mhmm
okay
good night  :white_heart: 
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
sorry

 :loudly_crying_face:

just thought id let u know
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mish I'm trying to be normal around my friends
How am I supposed to do that knowing my gf is horny and waiting for me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
sorry
That's okay
have fun  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sleep well  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Looking forward to calling u
 :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
oh my god
Yes
may or may not have had a _dream_
That message got my heart up
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
dream only involved texting
lmao
Right
and it was like
set today
as in
set in 20 mins ish
Omg
im kms
getting impatient now  :star-struck: 
I'm just trying to be
I'll probably be around the 40 minute mark sorry my darling
I'm edging yoi
it's okay honey
Building it up yk
Ugh
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Did you not, yk, do anything last night
no
lmao
Uh
Sorry
what are you apologising for  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo
edging?
Asking strange questions, being late, and your general, albeit presumed, pent-up state
And edging
it's fine
pent up state is totally your fault though yk
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mhmm
The fact I'm really glad we're watching a movie in the dark so my friends can't see my cheek colour is also your fault
lmaoo  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
glad to hear i'm not the only one
because then id actually kms
There's like 40 minutes of the movie left  :loudly_crying_face: 
I really wanna get back to my horny girlfriend  :loudly_crying_face: 
horny gf wants you to get back to her too lmao
Also omg, "my horny girlfriend lmaooo"
This is insane
lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face: 
yeah was thinking about that
I'm really down bad for you
I am too if you hadn't noticed
lmao
Yeah you've been not super subtle
yoy
my god
Think you can stay like this for another 45 minutes?
v difficult
Try your best darling
saying "try your best” and then saying "darling”
really not helping
I'm doing my best to keep you.. like this... Until I get back
So I can enjoy it yk
oh my god
yoy
What's up?
A little flustered? Just throwing out guesses here
very flustered
this is unfair
think about my moans from earlier  :white_heart: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
You can't do that to me
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  sorry honey
what you get for keeping me like this
Right after you said that
Daniel asked what I think about the movie
My heart can't do this
lmaoo
what'd you say?
I did a bit of stuttering
But honestly
Have not been paying too much attention to the movie
too busy?
My girlfriend being horny and texting me is a tiny bit distracting
mhm
understandable
think that's what she's trying to do though
That's rather mean of her
She's making her bf very flustered
think it's fair given that her boyfriend is edging her
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
My horny gf has successfully made her boyfriend horny
yay

You're so hot
I can't
you're not bad either darling  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
gotta be quiet though
need to use my phone's mic
<Media omitted>
Maybe if you don't swipe then away the notification
Maybe so you can keep reading it
hm
maybe
small possibility of that being the case
movie's close to finishing?
Very close
let out a small _sound_ to that
i'll let your imagination
do its thing
It's definitely doing it's thing
mhm
unrelated to horny
i think it's rly funny that your google maps location says torrington drive
i know youve shown me the sign and everything
Lmao
Not that unrelated to horny
Looking up your bf on Google maps because you're so eager for him to get homd
And have phone sex with you
Hm
please
I'm on my way back now
yay
idk how to join on discord though
like i want my phone
for mic reasons
but im assuming you also want video
even tho i look dead
Of course I want to see your gorgeous face
Silly
yoy
Going to Daniels house first kms
as in
hanging out???
No
or dropping off?
Dropping him off first
Okay
But that's 3 more minutes away from horny gf
I'd've kmsd if you were hanging out more
not to be dramatic but it's true lmao
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
did you unsend the attention whore message
omg
you did
Maybe
Sorry
it's okay
make up for it though
I'll make up for it
 :loudly_crying_face:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
we're so in sync lmao
Good at being horny together I guess

He wasn't so successful as a pickpocket on the streets of Bangkok, though, being arrested there for thieving a Slovak tourist's wallet in 2019.[7]" LMAOOO

You're such a sweetheart
<Media omitted>
yay
looking very fixed
at least it's working lmao  :loudly_crying_face: 
i'd cry if i didn't get those fixed points and had to go into a meeting w linus like that
now you have something to show for
its lit
mhm
yoy
is the blue line supposed to look like that
yoy what
i think it's just steep because it's the nullclines
and also this is on a log scale
i'm a bit ehh as to why it looks like it's overlapping
Ah right that's cool
Is it overlapping? Or just close
i think it's overlapping
but either way thats fine
its not a function
Is it not?
because it's just the points where d(mF)/dt is stable
Uh I don't get it
actually
wait
how'd i define it
ok maybe it shouldnt overlap
i think it might just be close
but either way fixed points seem roughly right
its tooo  lit
i mean it is vertical in a lot of places
bc of nullclines right
yes
i hope so
my god
my smart medicen girl  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
phone sex later!!
sorry
!!!
looking forward to it
too horny?
also lmaooo
appropriatly horny Id say
ok !
<Media omitted>
green is a trajectory
so it goes to the fixed point
:D
its working :D
well done
i am slightly concerned bc there should be a fixed point near 10^3 and 10^4 ish
but anyways
it's something
like anotherone? that isn't there
yes
<Media omitted>
I know
maybe the approximation is not good enough?
idk?
anyways i found that fixed point using a different method
can you make it so if the graphs are close it says they are in contact
and it makes a fixed point
hmmm
okay
yeah
thank you  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
coder boyfriend
that worked?
its lit
it did not :(
but ok choosing a different scale
<Media omitted>
idk why it doesnt come out as a fixed point
probably something wrong w the code
That's very clearly an intersection
Nah it's to do with the computer you wrote the code so it must be right
It's lit
lmaoo
thank u honey  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
sorry
horny thoughts be gone
?
Horny thoughts come back
i didnt even say anything  :loudly_crying_face:

Share with the class

????
as in god what is wrong w me for feeling the need to apologise when i havent even said anything

i am killing myself

You're so sweet
What did I do to deserve you
Everytime you talk to me you speak to me so softly
Every "are you alright” is so genuine and so caring
Awww
I just care about you darling
 :white_heart: 
I'm gonna cry
Thank you honey
Like idk but it's just so insane to me
that 1) someone cares this much 2) you care this much
I dont think you realise how insane this is to me
You're just a wonderful person
With maybe a bit of self esteem issued if you can't see that yourself
I'm gonna cry
I just feel so cared for
I'm so lucky
I don't think you realise
I'm gonna cry
You are such a genuinely good person
Please no crying swetie
I do care for you a lot, you deserve it  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
For you only
I care for you a lot
Like oh my god you can just tell
Like talking to you
I like talking to you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
You're just so corely good you know
Can't believe I'm dating you
I'm so lucky
Okay
I'll mull over that for a bit
Good night
Have fun  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Mmm
You're such a sweetheart
I really like you too
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

 :loudly_crying_face:

Oh right
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face: 
Does that mean if I take less time we'll have to wait for laundry
Yes
Before having phone sex
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yes
Sorry honey
First blocked by Gaurav
Now sheets
Kms
lmaooo
I mean
I guess sheets can wait till tomorrow morning

<Media omitted>
 :grimacing_face:  :toothbrush: 
its fine
They already anesthesiaed me
They didn't give me a choicr
Feels funny
The left side of my tounge is tingely  :face_with_head-bandage: 
and you have time to text me??
impressive
Yeah
Waiting for anesthesia to kick in
Already kicked in if you ask mr
Think I'm starting soon
oh okay
It's v weird
It's like pins and needles in my tounge
But only the left half
hmm
<Media omitted>
someone asked if you need a pcr test
you do not
Oh its lit
Does the government not have commentary on this?
idk rules always change
no proper website
Weird
you just gotta be up to date w the news
but also
they kinda stopped caring
and people worry about being asked at transit flights
rather than mongolian flights
But they used to care so much
Although the rest of the world largely stopped caring tbf
Thing is done
Mouth still numb
Texting on bike
<Media omitted>
Mouth will continue to be numb for the next 3 hours he said
fr?
washer's done in 3 minutes
then dryer
sorry babe
also told u it'd be 30 mins  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
am i not always right
i'm always right
You are always right
mhm  :white_heart: 
i feel so gross and sweaty
Why
i think i sweated while my hair was not dry
Is that bad
and now it's just permanently gross until the next wash
so like
More water doesn't change anything agreed
i could shower now
but also
probably better to shower after phone sex
yk
Mhmm right
i have two pillowcases
so i might just put one on
and then change it after i'm done
gonna have to do another load of laundry later anyways  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Huh
I don't get it
pillowcase will feel gross if i lay on it w gross hair
as in
relatively to clean mish
Riiighhhhtt
I also hold myself to that level of hygiene agreed!
mhm
<Media omitted>
lies
it was supposed to be done ages ago

Too many stairs if you ask me

Joyce locked the laundry room
Not to Kms  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
While my laundry was in it
Joyce strikes again
So I went to reception
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
And explained
that main house laundry's supposed to be open
And then the nice receptionist called Joyce
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
and then I had to awkwardly talk to Joyce otw to the laundry room
She's like "Oh I havent been here in a while”
And I had to be all like
"when did you come back”
Ms girl  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
so as to at least _seem_ oblivious to the fact that she's heard all my sex noises
Are we sure she heard
<Media omitted>

Alex  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I have been traumatised
There's a pigeon inside the lounge
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I was the first person there
Kill it
and opened the lounge door
For Jean
And it just flattered around
I was so scared
and then I saw the pigeon resting
on top of the door thingy
oh no
Lmao the pigeon is enemy no 3 and you're enemy no 2
are you emotionally ok
I'm not gonna kill my boyfriend
Is it white
from Jean
Uhhhh  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I dont know
because by that logic i would have to kill you and sobolev
<Media omitted>
you can have conflict of interest, like already disliking pidgeon + jean Tier 3 hatred = kill, liking boyfriend + Jean tier 2 Hatred = not kill
Mhmm I see
Fair
not gonna kill you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
such a sweetheart
mhm i know
i'm v sweet
Oh yeah
Jean named the pigeon Alex
Cause sobolev is also alex
so her top 3 enemies are all alexs
alexes?
idk
??????
I don't want to be a pidgeon
 :loudly_crying_face: 
share a name w the pigeon
you get smile and half of mongolia, I get a pidgeon  :loudly_crying_face: 
sorry
hey at least i have a history of liking alexes
that counts for sth?
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  ok
that makes up for it  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Linear algebra is too hard  :loudly_crying_face: 
oh no  :loudly_crying_face:

I'm talking to my mum
Mhmm
tiktoks will stop i think  :loudly_crying_face: 
so
Okie
good night babe
I miss you
Goodnight darling  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mish you too
You are so special to me
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh my god
You're probably asleep
But omg
Yoooy
Nope
Slept till 12 today remember
What's up
I do remember darling
I need an opinion
Go forth
<Media omitted>
What would you interpret this as
"its ok”
Buy or not buy
Not buy
I know right???
Because it's like your sending it and asking should you buy these
And she's like nah it's okay
Thank you  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yooy
Yooy
Just had an argument w my mum and sister about this
What happened
Right I see
They'll live
There are jeans in Mongolia
She was like "it's ok” means " it looks ok to me, you should buy it”
and she's like
you're too german
you need clarity
you should think more openly
???
Clarity for the thing she wants  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
I know
That's not how clarity works
And my mum is totally on my sister's side
Indra asked me which Jeans I got for her
I was like
i didnt get jeans ???
Like
Also the photo has multiple designs on it
If she doesnt tell me anything specific how am I supposed to tell
Yeah she also could have specified in that situation
You didn't ask which one to get
Just how do they look
My mum said I should've asked if I wasn't sure
I was supposed to be the one asking apparently
yoy
It's ok isn't a response to how do they look
It's ok it's just generally dismissive
I know right  :loudly_crying_face: 
Omg
Ridiculous behaviour
I thought I was going insane
Also you should be the one making sure and clarifying when you're getting stuff for her  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
yooy
I love having a supportive boyfriend
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Glad to help
Also all of this could've been avoided if she had just spoken to me in Mongolian
^ ok maybe not
But I am generally annoyed at how much English she uses ngl
Why's that
English is good  :cowboy_hat_face: 
It's because she will exchange a basic Mongolian word with the English word for it
She's going to be fluent in mongolian, she lives there picking up English is just a bonus
It's not like some of the ones that you dont really have in Mongolian
Like "awkward” is fine to say in English bc we dont rly have a word
She said "I'm not gonna *english* trust *english ends* you anymore”
I asked why she's doing that
and she's like
I forgot the Mongolian word
Does "get noobed" translate nicely?
???? What do you mean you forgot the Mongolian word
lmaooo
???
she forgot the word for trust
what  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh no
This is not good
And like
But there's no way
She doesn't become fluent in mongolian living in Mongolia
It's fine
(copium)
Plus that means she can talk to me when I come visit  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: *
You know like it's fine if she wants to speak English and stuff w anyone else
Like
Just not with me
If she wants to do it at school or anywhere it's fine
Mhmm alright I get that
And it's good to have a clear separation between home language and not home language
I say this even though I speak a mix of German and Mongolian
But if I speak a mix I will switch inbetween sentences
not random words
Ich bein ein auto  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
bein means leg
you said "i leg a car”
And?
I do leg a car
Got a problem with that ? :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 
Hmm
Okay babe  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm trying to make a dirty joke here but it's just not working out
Lmaoooo
Yeah I can't really see it either
Yeah
 :loudly_crying_face: 
No way to express horny i guess
sorry lmaooo
It's okay
I sort of like it when you're being my horny girlfriend
Okay
So
I am horny girlfriend like 60% of the time
I am girlfriend 100% of the time
so you on average sort of like it 80% of the time?
Cute girlfriend *
Is that how it works?
I don't get it
Me neither
I am just trying to talk to u
Haha aw
because you are my favourite person
Awwww  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
You're my favourite person  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
What a funny coincidence
mhmm v coincidental
I really really like you
Don't think I can like be chill around you
That time we were talking to Gaurav really
Ughhh
Can't be normal around you
I really like you too mishy
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:

You phone is like a piece of paper

 :person_shrugging: up to you
but your gf is genuinely stupid
Big doubt
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Babe  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Wait but I'm still confused
What's the printing for
booking confirmation
ie electronic ticket
Do you need that? And also can't you just pull it up on your phone if you do need it
not to be confused w boarding pass
Electronic ticket
On a piece of paper
Doesn't seem very electronic to ke
Me
shhhh
ive always printed it
Have you ever needed it
Asking for a friend
Yes
It's always been what I've shown at check inp
You don't have the machinese where you scan your passport or put in your name/flight or soemthing
No
My passport isnt biometric so I cant scan it
Ah
It's a passport diff I guess
Yeah
Tbf all plane trips I've done before coming to uni I just mentally check out and let my parents handle it
And since coming I kinda just show up and things work out
Existing is a little bit too easy :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark:  agreed!
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
When you have a good passport

yoy
<Media omitted>
Sneak on they won't notice
mhm
oh so do you have 3 hours to chill in the gate
mayhaps
although confused as to why i havent been through passport control yet
oh
becuase there are some domestic flights in the terminal
the international ones are sectioned off
so you just need to go to your gate once they announce it
and there'll be passport control at some point before then
Ah
Ok
thanks babe
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
my mum is just ignoring me lmao

Did you get through passport control
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
there was no passport control???
i am so confused
Did they look at it while going through security
They sometimes do that
No
And you might have been a little tired then
lmaoo there is no way i wouldve missed passport control
for people who dont have amazing passports
they ask you shittons of questions
practically threatening u  :loudly_crying_face: 
You sure? They do that once you're there probably
No
Since they didn't do it now
Any callers

because its being useless so I look up examples and I can't find anything like it
oh no
and was the inner product in C^n always the complex conjugate of the elements of the second vector?
I don't think so
and then they make the outer product a tensor product? I think?
You can define inner products differently
as long as they follow some rules
and also use the conjugate of the second one there, but don't bother saying it at any point
yeah I know
I looked at the rules
I suppose (|v⟩, |w⟩)=(|w⟩, |v⟩)* should have given it away
becuase dot products are independent of order
but idk
maybe right now isn't the best time to be asking about this stuff
idk braket notation
sorry honey
yeah
|v> is just a vector
I mean I'm still in the queue
Apparently my dad is here
It was unclear whether he would show up or not
uhhhhh
this is super positioned between good and bad until I get your take on it
lmaooo
good one
as in
good joke
Thanks
i think it's neutral
cause it wouldve been bad if he didnt
Don't ask me on my position tho, it will have to collapse then
but now it's gonna be awkward
lmaoo

I'm now looking at Yves Rocher which is a body shop - ish type store
they don't have it in the uk
i was annoyed about that
there used to be
but
brexit
and i think it just wasnt worth it continuing in the uk anymore
But basically they have my favourite shower gel
Which is like £5
and it smells really nice and of vanilla
Like
the scent is really strong
 :enraged_face: 
Like my dad came out of the shower
And I immediately said
Did you use my shower gel
Lmaooo
Because I could smell it
Even though I was p far away from him
You and your scents
He said yes awkwardly
More or less strong than Dior savage
Less strong
Lmaoooo
My mum then came in and she was like "yep that's definitely the shower gel”
This was two days before the where moss incident
Hahaha
if I have space in my suitcase I will definitely bring a bottle
Are you going to bring 7 bottles of it back to the Uk
after
I said a bottle
That's what I said  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Indeed you did  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
I bring this up because
There's this fragrance mist that I left at home
And I used it today
Smells like Mango
And my sister said it was way too strong
My mum said it smells nice
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I like Mish
I'm bringing that back definitely
I like Alex
It's LIT  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
and it's by Yves Rocher
and we're going to Shangrila tomorrow which has an Yves Rocher shop
Now the question is
The vanilla shower gel also has a fragrance mist
Do I get the fragrance mist
Yes
I like vanilla
Am in piano store
Oh this is fragrance mist you can put in your hair
So my hair would smell of vanilla
<Media omitted>
Sold
Fun
Exciting
woahh
That's insane
I wonder if they have testing kits for their shower gels
They all look so good
Okay
It's almost 4
I should sleep bc I'm definitely getting woken up at 8
Good night darling
Have fun at the piano store
Don't worry about me
Please
Okay
Goodnight  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sleep well
Good night  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm at lunch with the mum
Have fun honey
Shower gel  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
I'm going to steal it
And try it
Mhm
 :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
I might get the concentrated one where you only use a tiny bit each time and it's a small bottle
That's space efficient  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Yeah
Okay

oh this was, are you just wandering in the mall, not are you in the mall, " just wondering if you're at the mall"
Yeah I am wandering in the mall
i want round 10 in the evening
if you insist  :woman_shrugging: 
how does that sound?
sounds pretty good  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
wait when is your evening
yay
yay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
idk
i guess some point after you wake up
is it 11am for you rn
yes
i should go home soon
shouldnt leave my sisters alone for too long
alone with your mum?
my mum went to a different mall
^ also a point of argument here
oh no
she wanted you to look after them?
yeah
she was like
you can go to your provider later
is this the mall you were going to go to with sisters yesterday?
and then i was saying im meeting ganaa during the day
she was like
you can go with ganaa
no
but i dont want to drag her to stand in a queue  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
i dont know
she's just v annoyed w me
also bc i said i need to code during the weekend
shes annoyed because you need to code and you don't want to take your sisters to the mall for the queue?
no as in she doesnt want me to go to the mall at all
i am not crossing the road w my sisters if i dont have to lmao
is crossing the road stressful? hahah
and then she left her phone at home, realised like halfway on her way to the garage (like 7 min walk)
 :worried_face: why not
incredibly
no traffic light
cars
oh right forgot about that
then told me to go get it
then complained that i was too slow to get it
i am the fastest walker at home  :loudly_crying_face: 
thats annoying
im sorry darling
its okay babe
wait so you guys ended up at different malls
are you going to go back to your fam? even though you're meeting your friend at 1
cause she wants to go to squirrel housep
yes
they dont have my provider at the mall that she went to
home
my sisters are home alone
my friend has now also said that she thinks coming to me is v tiring (for the pizza place) which ngl i get but now we're meeting in the middle which means i have to leave home earlier
ah right, and squirrle house doesn't hjave internet
but like, yk its a job
Yes
??? why didn't she just go to your mall
And she's like
wait shes at the mall and sisters are home?
this mall doesnt have the stuff she wants
you should have organised your time better, which tbh, fair, but let me spend my only free week here freely  :loudly_crying_face: 
Okay darling
I'm gonna walk home
talk to you in like 15-20 mins ish
okie have a nice walk  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
sorry abiout everything
thanks :)
<Media omitted>
nvm they let me in
very nice of them to let you in
too generous
they didnt hear me
i am generally v  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  rn
also the queue was so long because they got rid of the two cashier desks which are for people who bought less than 5 items
wouldn't put it past them to just not let you in hahah
who buys more than 5 items at a mobile phone store??
no like the main mall part
the grocery store
part
that part was busy?
what did you get there?
Yeah
It's always busy
sunflower seeds

When are you going
like half an hour
Ah right
Forgot everyone is always late
And you should plan accordingly
i'm meeting her at 1.30
and it's a 32 min walk according to google maps
which means it's a 40 min walk accuratelt
1;30 ? I thought 1
bc it doesnt know that half the roads are closed
i asked to push back to 1.30 when she asked to meet elsewhere  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
oh where are you going there

in the middle
jetro supermarket to meet and then we'll decide where to go

It's not the 11th Khoroo anymore
?
They recently (3 years ago) switched to 17th Khoroo
Oh no
It used to be 11th Khoro
Khoroo
Personally I'm more a fan of the 11rh khoro
But that's just me
Mhm
Oh you're still home?
Not for long
Showering took me nearly an hour  :upside-down_face: 
The drain is clogged
 :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face:  :upside-down_face: 
Can't escape it even back home
It's cause of Indra
Her hair is way too long
And she doesn't care about the drain
Also I was shaving
So I had to wait extra long
To get rid of everything
I'm kms
How long did the actual showering take tho
That had to be a good chunk
The actual showering was about 90% of that
Because I had to keep turning it off
Because the drain was clogged
Can't you just
Like unclog it
Nope
It's not one of those like at nutford
It's like
Screwed into the floor
Does that make sense?
And it's just impossible to unclog
?
That's strange, there's no way to pick it up
Unless you call someone
And did UB get hot water back
And they unscrew it
Our district did
But my friend who lives in the same district says
The hot water comes and goes
I can probably find a screwdriver
But
 :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging:  :person_shrugging: 
Yeah too much work
Yeah I just want to shower  :loudly_crying_face: 
Maybe I will when they're gone
Darling
Sweetie
What's up
I like you a lot
Mmmm I like you a lot too
I'm not gonna let you go
I know
Physically and emotionally ?
Sounds good  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I meant physically
But emotionally works too
hence both
Okay
Have fun darling
I'm also gonna go
Text me  :white_heart: 
In case I'm not back by the time you sleep
Good night and sleep well sweetheart  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Goodnight  :white_heart:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh my god
I swear I'm gonna kms
You know how I said there was a really loud noise
Missed video call
Sorry that was a misclick
Apparently something fell
Now mum is scared for my life and has told my dad to stay overnight with me
I'm gonna kms
Or people are speculating that something fell
And my dad doesn't sleep
I'm gonna kms I want loud phone sex and the apartment is not gonna come crashing down
We're not even gonna be able to have quiet phone sex at this point
Apparently one of the apartments on the top floor had a fancy glass roof installed that came crashing down (people are safe)
I told my mum that now there's nothing more to come crashing down on us but she seems hesitant
My mum is more ridiculously anxious about stuff than I am ngl
She's like "who knows, maybe there's more to crash down” and I'm like "you're gonna have to be scared for the rest of your life by that logic”
*hoping my dad doesn't stay over and we can have loud phone sex*
Darling
I'm gonna close my eyes for a bit
Just call me when you wake up if I'm not up by then
I'll put my volume on loud
My dad is gonna come in then leave
Yay phone sex
He told me to do "go do whatever I want to”
But I can't close the door lol
bc that's rude
I can't hear you either darling
Ok now I can
You missed me?
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  darling
You sound tired  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

not the other thing
Okay in the car
My grandpa and my uncle are fighting
 :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
is this the frist time they've seen you
or were they at dinner
they've seen me before
Because my uncle nearly got hit by a car trying to leave its parking spot as he was leaving the driveway
And he let out a loud sound of anger (also some yooys)
My grandpa was like
Stop getting angry
yooooy
was it his faulty
No it was the other car's fault
he almost got hit
oh hes just road raging
it's barely a road  :loudly_crying_face: 
And he's like "I almost got hit why wouldn't I be angry”
and my grandpa was like "you always get angry, stop getting angry”
and then my grandpa said "this will always happen on the road you can't get mad - there's always gonna be these women driving”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
no need for that
while you're in the car too
lmao this always happens
my dad does this
my grandpa does this
my uncle does this
every man who drives ever does this
and then my dad is like "why dont you want to learn how to drive?”  :upside-down_face: 
No everytime something happens they're like "god damn it woman” or sth like that before they even see its a woman  :loudly_crying_face: 
and sometimes it turns out to be a man
 :loudly_crying_face:  thats really bad
this is very normal here
like i dont think its just my family
you should stand up to them  :relieved_face: 
but everyone
(mostly joking)
yeah no im not doing that
no energy for that
esp when i cant drive and refuse to learn how to drive
<Media omitted>
me neither  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh I finished reading the script that you were reading
hahah
also it is insane how it matches your energy
I would totally believe it (except for the part of me getting drunk ever)
I was thiking that as I was reading
I would totally say all those things
I know right
Like the sweetness in the beginning  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and then the uhhh you did say sth
slightly awkward
?
and then like the explaining why we're in one bed  :loudly_crying_face: 
oh right right
as in "uhhh you did tell me you liked me@
like "i dont have a couch + i dont wanna sleep on the floor”
Alex behaviour  :loudly_crying_face:

<Media omitted>

For some reason it can't be attached??
Why is this so stressful?
Yeah it's fine
You can also just send the text
<Media omitted>

they asked "do you know what bubble tea is”, "have you ever tried bubble tea”, "what is your favourite flavour”
:cry:
 :loudly_crying_face: 
oh no

nope

^ Is what Saulet messaged me yesterday
Bf?
And we called before I responded
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
So I was like "my birth control???”
to be funny lmao
And she was like
"are you on birth control?? should you be on birth control??”
I said "there's no point atm”
Lmaoo
She would say that
and she said "but there will be … oh no”
snd then she had her whole freakout over her not imagining her friends
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and then she asked if we talked about this
Understandable
They all ask that
this was at 9pm
All of your girlies
at 7pm
you made me uhhh
you know
2 hours ago we did talk about this
more than talk about this
but i just said "yeah we talked about this”
 :loudly_crying_face: 
that's all the girlies do
Lmaoooo
and she was like "oh nooo”
and she asked if i was gonna go on bc
I said no because of the hormones
I'm already a mess without the hormones
You're not a mess, you're a Mish!
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
good one
she said "oh yeah fair, just wrap it up”  :loudly_crying_face:  then she had a whole meltdown again
and i said "you keep asking and then having a meltdown”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
and she said "it's fine as long as i detach the people from it”
i think she might have a hard time detaching us lmao
I mean as long as we're not too attached in public and talk about it
It should be fine
But the again
If we disappear to a room people will probably get ideas
Lmaoo
Yes
Will they be wrong? I don't know  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
They'll probably be right
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Seeing as this is just a fact
But yoyy
someone my age is being called an in law

she has not asked me whether i have a foreign bf
partially bc she sees me as a 13 year old
Despite recognizing she's only one year older than you

Lamp
Forgot the word for a bit
Then we went to a department store that has never been brought up in conversation with you
I did not end up getting anything
Was looking at bras but they didnt have the adjustable straps so I didn't get anything
Yummy!!
Metaphorically
Lmaooo
The furniture store  :loudly_crying_face: 
At least not another mall
Get one with a simple strap please
Don't make it too difficult for me
You'll have to test this theory
Mhmm
I will no worries
it was just the straps were too short
And so I couldn't lower it
So it wouldn't sit right
Gah
Now I'm jail time again

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I want to have you lie between my legs and rest your head on my stomach, with my arms around your shoulders hands on your chest
I want you to feel comfy and safe  :loudly_crying_face: 
That sounds really really good  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mhmmm
Let's do that
Mhmm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ugh
I don't know how to describe it
But like
I feel like in straight relationships the guy isn't always like cared for gently ? does that make sense
Like
in some relns he's always big spoon
or taking care of her
and like
I don't want that
I want you to feel as comfy as you can be
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I think being around you will do that fine
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  you melt me
That's really really cute
Thank you mishy  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

expected to give more than they get
I don't want that
Tough
I'm giving you all the compliments and kisses
I want you to feel so cared for  :loudly_crying_face: 
And adored
No way you'll catch up
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

random thought; if i'm ever resting my head on your shoulder/chest and it's uncomfy tell me
by the intermediate value theorem
since comfyness is a continuous function
there must be sth that's comfy for both of us
we'll find it
ok? ok.
Ok darling

infinity
show it goes to 1

looking forward to that  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Then Saulet and Gaurav hugged you first
Then
We hugged and you spun me around
And they got pissed because we were PDAing apparently  :loudly_crying_face: 
By spinning around
lowkey
I can see that happening
but like
I dont thikn we would
but like
I want to  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
The thing is the PDA was just you picking me up and spinning me around for like 2 seconds
It's not like we made out or anything
yeah
thats pretty PDA-y
especialyl
when its very clear I did normal things with them but was waiting for you
know what im saying
Mhmm
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
This is gonna be a dilemma
Will we be alone
at all
eventually
in the first 2 hours
oh
after you arrive
first 2 hours
uhhh
maybe not
but I kinda wanna speedrun getting my stuff
Ohh right
Need maximum help
I still think it's funny you gave me a pillow to carry
I was v useless  :loudly_crying_face: 
hahah
yeah theres more stuff this time
so ill keep you busy
Okay
may need to hire saulet as wel
Mhm
She said her flight was on the 13th but she isn't sure
I could swear she told me 15th before
I'll ask her again closer to the time
mhmm
Mhm
How to stop mish from being affectionate w alex for several hours  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
it'll be tough  :loudly_crying_face: 
do you think they'll be like "maybe we should give you guys alone time"
If you just hug me for two seconds at Paddington I'll cry
and like leave us alone for a bit
I feel like they wont want to
Yeah
becuase they don't want us seperating
but also
we'll be painfully obvious
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I know  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Dilemma
Gaurav will not want to especially
He will want to maintain regular GASM
well while I was talking to him
he was like I think we'll keep GASM dynamic
Oh he said that??
He asked me during the _conversation_ what I thought
but he'll be _cagey_ with things beacause I didn't tell him about you and that'll be the change in dynamic
which like
I think thats fair
Yeah
yeah
its all good  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
we're all  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
I said I think it'll stay the same longtime
And did not mention anything short time but he probably pieced together that I meant I want alone time w Alex in the beginning bc I havent seen my boyfriend for ages
yeah  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But also
I want alone time with mishy  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
not because I don't like other people
but because I reallyl ike mishy
Do you remember how he says "I think it's bullshit to leave couples alone”
^ which long term agree
but short term  :loudly_crying_face: 
I want Alex time
that was specifically like not hanging with them on your own volition
offering alone time is diff
Mhm
copium
they totally wont  :loudly_crying_face: 
But I doubt we'll get alone time
Maybe in the evening
how long do you thikn we'll have to wait
But the thing is
If we leave
3pm - 11pm?
Gaurav and Saulet
yes
are more likely to leave as well
they'll def be weird about it
but like
you know what
I don't really care that much
and we're essentially ending the hangout
its so incredibly understandable for me to want my mishy, O
Yooo
I'm gonna be pretty presumptious here and hope they understand
Is this a typo
Or
yeah
?
what else would it be
orgasm
big O
right
how does that work
I want my mishy, *ORGASM*
it's incredibly understandable for me to want my mishy orgasm
theres a comma
and we are not orgasming night 1
uhhh
well
probably
Yeah we're not
Probably
I dont think we'll be that horny
Rightt
Also
uhhhh
too tired
Mayhaps?
Maybe make out?
idk
after not getting any touching for 8 horus
we'll see
we shall find out :)
okay
I land at 4.50pm
the day before
Which means I will be wherever at like
6pm
earliest
oh no
Which means
No grocery runs
I'll be exhausted
after like
16 hours of travelling
yeah  :crying_face: 
poor mishy
I wont have my sheets cause they're in boxes
ah right
I will tho
getting stuff from aunts
Mhm
need to do that on the day I get back since they're leavign for isle of white the day after
right
right
It's gonna be v difficult not to affection
For a bunch of hours
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
yeah  :loudly_crying_face: 
Bro I'm gonna be staring at you
lmaooooo
ill play piano nws
Lmaooo
Amplify the attraction?
If you play für Elise without doing the nose thing I will cry
I think ill have to
for the sake of our friends lunch staying in their stomaches
lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face: 
Don't play für Elise then
Just play god save the queen
then again
Common room's gonna be p full in the beginning
of the year
oh sick
We won't be alone
get to flex on the newbies
for the nose thing
:(
And I need to hear für Elise
So I guess
play für Elise
We can go to music room for that
Ohh
Yay
But also Joyce and Shanice think next year is gonna be a lot of RAM people
Shanice is like 80% RAM
You should tell Saulet or garuav to buy you a sandwich before hand or soemthing
Eat food  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Nah that's too much
Yeah agreed
That's not what I meant by grocery run  :loudly_crying_face: 
But I will
tell them to
Uhhhh .. What did you mean
I have no idea ..
Things we need before O
lmao
I mean we dont need that for O
I mean yeah
you can do O without PIV
I know
I've seen people
do
guy finishes girl, girl finishes guy
yeah
that souds horrible
so no contact
really hope we dont do that
that would be terrible
I would hate that
But also
Since I take like an hour  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Can you deal w that
take an hour doing it yourself too
and you're def better at it than me
Is a good q to ask
Right
I can help you out
eventually
not day 1
maybe
probably not
potentionally not
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
we're gonna be horny
its doomed
We're gonna be so horny
Kms
(lmao what happened to "do you think we can go without kissing for a whole day”)
we
will try our best
will we?
We will
try our best
I think it'll depend
because I've never noticed
how much different I think around you when I"m horny and when I'm not horny
Lmao
mhm
going to breakfast
<Media omitted>
okie im gonna take drugs
<Media omitted>
sleepy soon
Okay
Good night babe
cutie  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sleep well  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
talk to you when you wake up
goodnight darling  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
looking forward to seeing you
same honey  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
This sentence took me a v long time to understand
I did not understand it while we were walking to breakfast
I think I still don't fully understand
I phrased it poorly
But like, the difference in how i think and act when I'm horny for you and when I'm down bad for you is so dramatic that I actually noticed
Anyway back to sleep
Seriously?
That dramatic?
I mean the way you act is clearly different lmao  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  but I assumed that was just for mood funsies
Like I don't think you'd call me all those things when you're down bad
Or tell me you'd pin me to the bed and take my clothes off if I teased you in person when you're down bad (this one is obvious but it's a fun one to say so I said it£
yoy
we might be going soon i think somewhere not sure though - cover for the last message so there's no horny shit on my last sent  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah I mean I'm saying dramatic things but like I'm just generally more sexually down bad
Morning darling
Good morning
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
by sexually down bad do you mean just horny or specific things?
Horny
<Media omitted>

It's hard when I finish first because then I'm sort of out of the mood, so starting right after I finished wasn't the best  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'll last longer next time agreed
it's okay
was cleaning up just now sorry
but it made me feel a bit uncared for :(
I'm sorry darling

Hi there
Hey
Good morning
Morning
How'd you sleep darling
alright
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
i had a _dream_
Ah
Do tell
so I woke up just like you woke up
As in
Horny
Yes
Well I think you telling me about the events of you dream will help
Get it out yk
Thing is
I don't remember that much
Just woke up horny
We were texting
I think
 :person_shrugging: 
Hot
and
then you started calling me names again
Then I think I started imagining stuff
^ definition of stuff is unclear
Mhmm
Mhmm right
and then I was horny
and then I was texting you telling you I was horny
and you were teasing me
getting me worked up
I couldn't do anything tho lol
I think I was out
so you were just
Mhmm doesn't sound all that much like a dream
Seems totally pheasbale
making me more and more horny
And I was just like
lmao this is embarrassing
but
Turning you on more?
more and more desperate
folding v hard
basically
Also
Haha
There is no way anyone can read texts rn right
other than u
Mhmm
So now I'm horny
lol
Mhmm
Can't imagine why
That totally makes one of us
yoy
if you're not joking I'm gonna kms
I am joking
But also
I'm with Leo
So ..
yeah got it
are you staying in the same room
are you guys doing anything?
No
Watching c9
oh okay
Ah
Right
c9 beating evil geniuses??
Yeah
They won first 2
Very surprising
mhm
good for them
Was winning game 3, just lost tho  :frowning_face: 
That's okay, win the next one
yeah
gf is v horny
yoy
Yoy
Cheeky fell asleep
while watching c9?
Sort of
Been a long day
mhm
yeah
figured
yoy
hate to tell you this
Yoy
I also fell asleep but I keep waking up cause #jail
Mhmm
Can't wait until we solve problems like this by me fucking you
Can't wait
let out some _sounds_ to that
Mhmm
 :relieved_face: 
ugh
I want you to fuck me
Soon enough darling
Good girl admitting that
oh my god
i'm so horny for you
Mhmm
I know
Good
I know this is super cheesy, but I feel like we've been cringe enough recently to justify it
Can't wait to make your pussy mine
Mhm
Like I want you too horny from being fucked to think properly
I think that's v achievable
Easily achievable tbh
Glad to hear it
cause even just during phone sex my brain shuts off
you'll have to test out and see what happens during actual sex
It'll be better watching you lying under my body
oh fuck
I wanna see you squirming
When you cum for me
Think I'll be squirming a lot, not just when I cum for you
Like now maybe?
Mhmm
Yeah but I want to see it
I know you do
I want to hear you moan for me
I wanna see you out of breath and feeling good for me
I want to see your face as you fuck me
I want to see how your expression changes
with your eyes closed
I want you to moan in my ear
I want to be moaning for you
I also want to watch your expression as you're being fucked
Fuck
Maybe too busy kissing you but
Idk
I'm so horny for you
I'm horny for you too
Can't do anything about it  :loudly_crying_face: 
Just think about how much I want to look at my hot girlfriend being fucked by me
Mhm
I want to see my pretty girl with my dick in her pussy
Fuck
I want to leave hickeys on you
I'm going to leave hickys on you
Not because I want to
But because I'll be so horny from kissing your neck
Oh my god
And your chest
All while in inside of you
I'm gonna fuck you
Oh my god
Im going to be inside of you
Fuck
That's so hot
Alex
I want you
I know you do
In going to give you me
This message was deleted
I can't wait
c9 just won
What did that say
It said "I know you will” but then I thought that might be a bit too presumptuous and I didn't wanna make you uncomfortable
Hahah
did they not?
I'm confused
Why is it not updating
I thought it was something too hot
Why are they so happy
They did win yes
No sorry babe  :loudly_crying_face: 
I told you I would and you're like saying I know is too much  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mish
No need to fret
I'm definitely going to fuck the shit out of you
Thoughts
1) that's really hot
2) I hope he doesn't mean literally
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mish
I'm just gonna fuck you then
because that would be messy
And not fun
Yes it would  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's a common expression  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmaoo sorry  :loudly_crying_face: 
Am I ruining the mood
But it's also kinda funny
I know
 :OK_hand:  maybe a little
sounds all g to me
All g to me too
My horny dirty slut who I'm gonna fuck  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh that's kind of a fire bar
It is
My god
I really wanna fuck you
I know you're gonna make me weak
But I also want to make you weak
I really really want to hear you moan for me
Want you to tell me how good I feel
That you want more
Mhmn
I want to be weak for you
You're gonna fold me so hard
I'm this horny just texting you
I'm gonna be down horrendously when you're there in front of me
Asking to be fucked
That is asking in the litteral sense not asking by wearing small clothes or something
It's a woman's right to do things like that and consent is important and no menas no
Ofc
I got that Alex  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yes darling
Most days, I'll probably be so horny that I'll be asking for it
But some days I want to rile you up and tease you till you're asking for it
Watch my man get more and more horny
Your man will be so horny for his sexy slutty girlfriend
I'll sit on your lap
I want to feel you getting hard for me
Mhmm, looking forward to feeling you through my dick as it grows next to your body
Mhm
Looking forward to seeing you getting wetter for me
I wonder if you'd be able to feel my pussy throbbing
I have no idea how strong it is lol
I am genuinely curious
Your pussy dripping, wetting through your panties
We'll have to test that out I guess
Yeah I suppose so
Actually funny coincidence that
My dick is actually very sensitive to throb like motion
So maybe that would be a good means of going about that testinf
Idk just throwing out ideas
Good to know
Sounds like a plan
Indeed it does
also let out some small moans to that
Wanna call
Fr?
Ye
of course I want to
Ok
Good night babe
Goodnight  :white_heart: 
Text me when you wake up

Okay darling

Don't worry about me
I'm not
Good

Missed video call
alright its like 12 pounds per person for a train to stanstead and 16 for a coach
dont know how that works but  :woman_shrugging: 
lmao
okay
oh wait its 10 if you book in advance
but like train vs bus and 1hr 5 minutes vs 2 hrs is not worth 2 pounds
what
im confused
the train is 2 pounds cheaper
wia tno
the bus is 2 pounds cheaper
but it takes longer and is less comfy
ah yeah
okay
gotcha
wait which flight are we looking at
07:15->09:55
and then
17:40->18:20?
yeah
but conversions are hard for me
so probably
from 24 to 12 horu time
but that's like
so I think vaguely:
airbnb 2 nights so like 100?
get to the airport ~4~ 2 hours early
mhmm
so like we need to be there by 3pm
but like its a small airport
so not that expsneive
i mean
not that crowded
so we dont need to be there that early
 :loudly_crying_face:  hence 2 hrs
riggghhhtttt
I got to gatwick like 1hr30 before
but sure whatever you say mossy
Please
I guess we won't have any baggage to drop off
How crowded do you think it'll be on the 24th
we can take the german tube to the airport  :relieved_face: 
its lit
airbnbs are expensive tho
 :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I wanna find the one I was at w my mum

It had one bed
and they gave you champagne

you're so cute  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Man I really like you
Any chance you're able to call your girlfriend for 2 mins?
In a few minutes
Okay honey
Can't wait till I can do that in person
Fucking you
I wanna have sex with my cute girlfriend
I wanna hear her cute noises and see her cute body
I was just gonna tell you
That you'd officially turned me on lmao
I know
yoy
If you can keep yourself like that for another 390 hours I'll make use of it
Very good use I promise
Oh my god
Do you think I should call Saulet or are you gonna keep turning me on
Uhhh
Probably call saulet
Cause I only wanna call her after you're done
I'll leave you alone
Okay
Oh
But if you wanna sext
I told her to call me in a little while
Little while usually means like half an hour
Ok good
I wanna fuck your cute pussy
Oh my god
Very intense here aren't we honey
I'm extreplating that it's cute from the rest of you
Yes
I'm v horny for you
I'm very horny for you too
Regretting not wearing something lowcut
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Wish you were
Do you
Or do you wish that I wasn't wearing anything
Not over video call, that's cringe
Wouldn't mind you naked if you were under me
It is cringe
Easier for me to insert myself into you that way
Also would set off like 100 anxiety thoughts of hackers
Fuck
Please do
And that way I get to see your gorgeous face blush as my dick enters you, and I get to play with your sensitive tits
Yeah so that wouldn't be bad all in all
Oh my god
But I also like it when you tease me with the low cut stuff
I love knowing you're making me hard for you, and you're being wet for me
Mhm
You like me on all fours for you don't you
I really do
Think I'll like the view from the back better though
Mhm
Right
That would be really hot
Not knowing when you'd enter me
I can't wait to feel your wet pussy, thinking about it turns me on so much, being around it, inside of it..
I'm gonna fuck you
Please fuck me
Mmm that's a good girl
I want your dick inside me
I want you to move it back and forth till I can't think straight
I know you do
Oh my god
Yeah I will
I'll fuck your pretty pussy just for you
I want to push your head down, grabbing your hair and burying you in my chest
I can't wait to be buried in your chest
While you're moaning
Mhm
Hear my heartbeat as well maybe?
or do you think I'll be too loud for that
I think I might be  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Make sure of it please
Yeah I think you'll be too busy telling me how much you like my dick for that
You know, because you're a whore for me and want me to fuck you
Mhm
I really want you to fuck me
What are you up to now!
*?
Just lying in bed
Thinking about being on top of you
Well that's not really true
On top/inside of you is more accurate
Mhm
Did I mention I'm really hard for you
Don't think so
I'm pretty wet for you too
Panties are a little soaked
Well in that case, I'm really hard for you and really want to fuck that wet pussy of yours
Glad to hear it, that's my dirty little slut  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I really want you to fuck me
I really want to fuck you
So that works out well
I want to suck on your neck as I'm riding you
Oh my god
Hear your moans
Please do darling
Very close up
I promise you I'll be moaning for you
Fuck
That's the way I like it
I can't wait to be with you mishy
I love hearing you moan for me
Better keep your promise
I can't wait to have you on my dick
Mhm
Can't wait to be on top of you
Or under you
Both work
I'm going to dig my nails into your back cause of how good you feel
Yeah both sound good
when I'm riding you
Not too hard though
Mhmm
Unless you'd like that..?
I really want to make you feel good
You will
I'm really horny for you
Can't wait to climb on top of you
Figured
Can't wait for you to climb on top of me
I can't wait for me to be fucking you and then throw around your body while your dazed from being fucked and put you in whatever position I want
Oh my god
Fuck
That's so hot
That's so hot
Please do
I promise I will
I'll have you on top of me and push my dick up into you
I'll have you face down and present your dripping pussy to me
Oh my god
Fuck
Please
I'll have you spread your legs like the slut you are for me
Oh my god
I really want that
I can't think at this point
That's too hot
Then I'll have you on your side and I'll slowly slide my dick into you with my arms around your front
I want you to feel comfy in my arms while I'm thrusting into you
I want you to feel my warmth while I'm playing with your tits
I want you to hear me shake a little bit each time I fully thrust into you
Oh my god
That's so hot
That's too hot
I'm so horny for you
Im so very horny for you too
I really really can't wait to fuck you
Wish you could feel me throb
Ill feel you throb from the inside
Fuck
I'm so wet for you
Need to clean up later
Mmm
There's a little bit of precum in my underwear, maybe we wouldn't be having this problem if you weren't so hot
Keeping me so hard
I'm so hard for you
Fuck
I can't wait until I can deal with your wet pussy properly
I can't wait either
I want to play with the clit of your wet pussy
I want to feel you shudder each time I graze it
I want to kiss your body
My fingers are always cold, especially during the winter. I can't wait to run my fingers across your chest as we're starting and hearing you make little sounds of anticipation everytime I touch you
Also babe we've been sexting for almost half an hour  :loudly_crying_face: 
I doubt she'll call at exactly the half hour mark
More*
more than half an hour?
Oh my god I'm going to moan for you so hard
.
35 minutes
Damn
Okay
Mhm
I'm going to take raggedy breaths each time you touch me
Fuck
I want to hear that
I want you to touch me
Mhm
I want you to fuck me
I'm going to fuck you
Please do Mish
I'm gonna make you feel real good
I want you to fuck me so bad
I will
It's good to hear that you're so eager
I'm so eager for you
I'm so desperate for your pussy
I want you to drip onto my dick
Will do
Will be pretty easy
Given how wet I am now and how wet I will be when I'm having sex with you
I want to feel you drip onto me in anticipation of you lowering yourself onto me
I really really want to feel how wet you are myself
All in due time babe
Mhmmm
I'll fuck you good
Promise
Thanks Mish
I'm going to hold you to that
I'm also going to hold you
I'm also going to have sex with you
That last part was unrelated to the one before it im just really eager
Pin me against the bed
I will
Pin my hands above my head as you what you want
I'm going to press you up against the wall
Fuck I really want you to pin me against the wall, make out with me till my knees are weak and then throw me onto the bed
You won't have anywhere to move
Im gonna make out with you until you're out of breath
In gonna touch your pussy through your panties
Oh my god
Fuck
I'm gonna grab your ass and stroke your thighs
And then I'll pick you up
Throw you onto my bed
I'll undress myself
I'll rip off your slutty shorts and panties
Fuck
Then I'll climb on top of you
I'll pause for a second on top of you
You'll have me begging for it
My dick so hard, hovering between our bodies, your pussy already staining the sheets
I'll make out with you some more and touch you a little bit more just so I can hear your moans with my tounge in your mouth
Fuck
And then, if you beg for it like a good whore, I'll slowly insert the tip of my hard dick, into your dripping pussy
Oh my god
You know I'll beg for your dick
I know you will, I know you're a little slut like that
fuck
I want to wrap myself around you
As I'm fucking you
Riding you
Your pussy will do a good job of that
Yes please
Feeling you
I want to see your face filled with pleasure
I want to hear your moans
I will be
I want to pull your hair
Please
Also
Babe
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I think I should really call Saulet
Yeah
You do that
As much as I want to continue being horny w you
I found a bathroom
Right
<Media omitted>
Have fun
Thanks babe
Oh my god
Is that actually how it sounds when I'm against the mic
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Oh my god
V hot
Okay
g2g
Have fun darling
Ok
Ttyl
<Media omitted>
lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
done?
Mhmm
Saulet just asked me what we talked about
Stuff
Things
I said you talked a bit about Spain and the hotel
And then we were being cringe
ie being smitten
Because I realised you talking about Spain would not take up an hour
Good cover
Let out the lowtier cringe to cover the high tier ceinge
yes
She was suspicious when I said "We were being cringe” and she was like "How cringe..?” with a scared voice
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  what'd you say
I said we were just looking at each other and going "aww”
also she said she wants to go to Germany w me
So I had to tell her about Nürnberg
She called us sneaky bitches
She was like "omg you're booking trips??”
I said we havent booked yet
Maybe tell Gaurav about it before he hears from Saulet and the whole "you dont tell me things” thing starts again?
Oh no
I told him when we hung out I'll be home for Christmas
And then I said well maybe not
But I'm not going back to California
And he's like what do you mean by that
And I uh
Didn't elaborate
Opps
Home for christmas? Home as in London?
Yeah
Which is mostly true
Yeah
You'll be home on Christmas day
Mhmm
Lmao
apparently Zara said we seem like a long term couple
She was like
"I think they're gonna get married”
That's more approval  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mhm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
send updates babe
<Media omitted>
Honey
I just told my mum about Nurnberg
Darling
And me?
Yes
But like
I didnt explicitly say it
She did bring up the airbnb we stayed in
w one bed tho
so I'm p sure she assumes ?
Yay
And she brought up 1 bed ajrbnb
We take those
She's like with who? I was like w Alex
And she's like "oh did he suggest it?” i was like yeah
It's lit
She knows I'm a cutie
Also phone is low
So maybe die
If so I'm sorry I don't get to goodnight you
Premptive goodnight  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
Okay babe
Have fun  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Good night if you don't get to say good night  :white_heart:

Oh yeah she totally knows
You were not hiding at all
Yeah  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

that was lucky
Cause you said "next 4 hours” so I was defo not expecting you to come back during that
how much before me coming back did you start
ok technically like 30 minutes but 20 mins of those were left handed and i have 0 coordination in left hand so i got up washed my hands and switched to right hand
why did you do left handed hahah
i did not realise i was doing left handed  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
but also I feel like lower intesnity warm up can't be written off

Yeah
but the turned on was intense
first time

Mhmm
I'm surprised you didn't do a bit of stroking

I was kind of thinking
I can't let this get out of hand
Cause I need to call Saulet
Yeah
Fair enough
But also if I did I would've been totally unable to reply
cause
Even just a little bit?
Anyway
A little bit would make me want more
Doesnt matter
Sleepy time darling

Mhmm
Also for myself

not as satisfying as i had hoped
:(
they're still together? after 2 years? good for them  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

No
Kinda just accepted that in Mongolia as long as ppl are like "i tolerate it” it's more than I can ask for  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :person_shrugging:

Also
I got a tiktok video about the dick waffles
but in barcelona
not london
so i was looking for the name
It's a chain?
of the london one
I think they're the same idea
and i remembered gaurav went there
so i searched "dick” in whatsapp
and uhhh
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Kms
gaurav's message did not pop up
but all of ours did  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
it's because it's called the cockery rather than the dickery
Right
I'm so tired
 :frowning_face: 
Poor mishy

Then we're taking a train out of the city
Then we're cycling either 27 miles or 44
Depends if we take long route or short route
Okay
So is that like the whole day
More or less
Okay
We'll probably stop for lunch at like 2ish?

Looking forward to it x  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes:

Being Mish is v hard

A bit more than an hour
That's a record right

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
kms
this is really bad babe
It seems like a lot of work
youre gonna have to tease me the whole day
and then have sex w me at night
you need me to be like
mega horny
I don't think that does anything
for v long
idk
Because sometimes you're like moaning at convo for like 30 minutes
its been easier when ive had to wait
Then we start and its from square one
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :skull:  :skull: 
On the train now
<Media omitted>
darlinh
Darling*
Am back
With washed hands
Can text w both hands
It's toooo lit
<Media omitted>
My god
exhausted
 :loudly_crying_face:  poor mishy
Why am I cursed like this
What did you do it to
always horny + can't get off?
Texts?
Lmaoooo
Yeah
Maybe just watch porn?
You can like tape my face over the guy if you'd like
i don't know
Also I'm beginning to understand why you didn't do it the whole year
It's a work out and an evening gone
My god
I know right
And I didn't really have any evenings to myself at all this year
Really?
Yeah
Ok till November maybe
but after that I was doing stuff all the time
I'd either be in the quiet room till 1 or in Saulets room
If you go into Saulets room of your own volition that doesn't mean you didn't have an evening to yourself
or doing maths w Jean
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
okay fair
but like
i usually go in expecting to talk for a bit
and then leave
usually is an exaggeration
but frequently
then i end up leaving at like 1-2am
Mhmm
I am so tired
Nap time?
I dont know
Maybe
Also idk porn always feels uncomfy to watch
I haven't in like a very long time
By very long time I mean I don't remember how old I was
16?
Probably 16
lmao
:(
Audios it is
I feel like that would work well for you
Yeah
The gone wild audios are too much though
Most of them
As in there's a lot that I could never listen to
Like the first thing that eliminates a lot of things is the fact
There were some wholesome enough ones
That I can't hear the word "daddy”
Lmao
Ok the thing with those is
The wholesome ones require emotional connection  :loudly_crying_face: 
Mish please
Want me to record some for you
I know I know
I'll stop whining
 :eyes:  :eyes:  :eyes: 
Fr??
Don't see why not
Omg
Alex
The things you do for me  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Maybe I'll post them too who knows
Jkjkjk
Quickly went from  :eyes:  :eyes:  to  :skull:  :skull:  there
Mhmm
Oh yeah
Tomorrow
School starts
Do you know what that means
For sisters?
I'm home alone in the mornings
Yes
Tomorrow is also Nutford day
aka nights 4 u
I am aware
Oh
Exciting
Which means
I can be vocal again
Oh
It's lit
I like being vocal
Also because I can usually not get many words out while uhh
Phone sex
And listening to how hot you are
Mhmm
Right
only from like 7:30am tho
I'll look forward to it
If I can escape
Oh that's pretty late
Yeah
Idk if I'll be awake then
Oh wait
Cycling will take you out
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I definitely won't
That's 130 am for me
Yeah
You'll be exhausted
Yule will be exhausted
Yule will be exhausted in Indeed
mhm
Maybe I can record audios too?
so you can listen to them later
That'd be fun  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
And I think they're done by 1pm or 2pm
which means unless you're up at 6am which is just not gonna happen
it's not feasible
I was up at 5 today  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
I guess
 :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
We'll see
In any case
I'll see you on the 15th
Yes you will
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Wait
Why is porn unconfy
Internalised misogyny  :exclamation_question_mark: 
mayhaps
You're a strong independent woman
Idk afterwards you just feel so shit
Do you?
I don't think it's just that
Yeah I guess I can see that
Mhm
Well if you hold on a bit longer
Hopefully it'll be easier with me there x
Hopefully  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ugh you're such a darling
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Also
I wanted to bring this up w you on call but
Maybe we shouldn't have sex on the first day
I know I'll want to
I know you'll want to
Probably
But I think that I just wouldn't feel good about it afterwards
Mhmmm
Yeah that's a good idea
Whatever you're comfy with
If you aw-ed at that you need higher standard
attacked  :skull:  :skull: 
I definitely awed at that
but you're also right
 :skull: 
Just cuddles n stuff please
Mhmm
Lots of cuddles  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Should we aim for birthday present?
Mhm
Yeah
That sounds like a decent amount of time to wait
maybe a bit before
because it's not gonna be good
Yeah
It's really a question of if we can make it that long
Yeah
Not should we
We should try to wait though I think
I think it's good to have wholesome time first rather than dive into sex almost immediately
Yeah
Because otherwise I'll feel bad about it
Not cause there's anything wrong w it
and also to soak in the wholesomeness
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Omg
The girl who has a baby
Just posted a story
It's a video
There are like 7 of them but whatever
Her boyfriend's holding her baby and taking care of the baby
And then she's holding his bank card
and she asks "My love, whose card is this”
You can see all the details as well  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
Both sides?
And he says "it's your card”
No
It's fine then
Right?
So I guess its fine
But like still  :loudly_crying_face: 
My mum says that a lot
And she's like "how much money is there on it?”
He says "238k”
which is like £60
But like, she makes almost nothing, 1) compared to my dad it's like nothing 2) she gets put into my dad's tax bracket so most of it goes away
Lmaooo
If we work in silicon valley together
This will not be an issue
Because we'll have so much money between us it doesn't matter
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Not that I've thought about that
Way too early
Ok GTG
If I however change my mind again and go into academia
Getting off train
Oh okay
Talk to you later babe
Continue
We will be in that same situation except I will also be infinitely more stressed than you are
Response may be sparce
that's okay darling
Mhm
Also other things that are way too early to think about
The long distance year is gonna kill us
If we get to it which I hope we will
as in kill us emotionally not kill the relationship
I hope it doesnt kill the relationship
Yeah
I don't like thinking about that
At least it's short long distance
Yeah
Not like 10 hr flight
1 hr flight
You will have to come though because I will lose my right to enter the UK
1hr flight 30£ no need to pay for accommodation
Yeah
It's kinda lit
Omg
Things that are not too soon to think about: Nürnberg!!!
I'm so excited
Oh my god
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
We're gonna have mulled wine
It's been like 6 weeks since we started
That's a decent amount of time
It's kinda lit
Yeah
Mhm
I like having you as my gf
I think the general rule of thumb is not to plan ahead for longer than the length of your relationship
But  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
I like having you as my bf  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and candied almonds
and chestnuts
and look at cute decorations
and have hot waffles
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
hot cocoa
Also we will get bratwurst
Don't really like fruit stuff
Nürnberger bratwurst
Rest of stuff sounds good
I remembered that as soon as I sent that message
I don't think mulled wine tastes like fruits though no?
idk
anyways
We're gonna walk in the park
It's gonna be so cute
And it's gonna be cold
But we'll snuggle up and warm each other up
OMG
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU GO TO GERMAN GROCERY STORES
All my favourite snacks
OMG
I dont think ive ever sent a message in all caps to you
Maybe that's one thing you could try to write as well
like something that only filters for all caps messages
should be easy enough no?
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I still can't believe you thought Hanuta was nutella
How would that even work
It would just be squished
Omg
We're gonna have to get Knoppers
I saw Knoppers at Al Mustafa
We can get it as soon as we're in London
I was gonna suggest Yogurette but remembered that's strawberry flavoured
Omg Alex you have no idea
I'm so excited
We're gonna get so many German things
OMG
I'm gonna make you try the yogurt rice cakes
They're my favourite thing in the universe
Also these snacks called
Ok
Don't laugh
Dickmanner
Dickmänner
which means "fat men”
I'm p sure by this point you know that dick means fat/thick depending on context
My friends always make fun of German for this
and you're friends w Leo
Surely it must have come up
Babe
I'm so excited
omg
I'm gonna make you try so many Rittersport flavours
We're gonna get like 10
idc
I'm so excited for us
Also I keep getting fencing videos on my recommended on if
ig*
Instagram knows I'm dating a fencer  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
That's nice
<Media omitted>
Yay!!
How was it?
How many km?
Lonng route short route?
Wait no
Mare it half way there lol
Yeah assumed so
Cause it's lunch time
Made it to lunch
More like 1/3 of the way there
But it was nice
A bit hilly at times
<Media omitted>
Gorg indeed!!!
What're you up to
Comforting Jean
She's about to go take a nap
Oh no
I think
Did one go poorly
Her fever is really high
She didn't submit
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Poor Jeanie
The universe is so mean to Jean
I know
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
She's done nothing
And everyone is so mean to Jean
 :frowning_face: 
How's the food
She went to bed I think
She stopped replying
We've been given a little food
But it's tapas
Oh
Waiting on more food
We got a potato salad and fancy ham
Fancy ham?????
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
what the hell???
yay
You've never seen that
Cured ham
I have not
Strange
Is Jean going to be ok
Uhhh as long as she doesn't miss more than one more exam and passes all her exams
I think she'd be fine
^ If she does that then she has to interrupt
 :pensive_face:  poor her
i.e. not study during 2022-23 and then do 3rd year in 23-24
Physically she's not doing well
Why's that
Because then you're not guaranteed to progress from Y2 to Y3
So you can't go into year 3
Oh if she does miss stuff she has to do that
Yeah
How many left
Because if she's really dying
Can she do the rest
3 left
One tomorrow
She can do it  :relieved_face:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
<Media omitted>
You're such a good big sister
And a good girl
Oh my god
Please don't start this
Or do
But in a bit
she insists on bringing 3 different shades of red
They don't fit in her pencil case  :loudly_crying_face: 
Which one
Seems like emulen behaviour
Emulen
<Media omitted>
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I told her her pencilcase doesn't close
and she's like
It does close
And she proceeded to demonstrate by taking a bunch of things out and closing it
<Media omitted>
Hahahh
It is  :loudly_crying_face: 
Let's goooooo
<Media omitted>
I'm gonna show up at their opening tomorrow
and everyone's gonna assume I'm Emulen's mum  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Indra just checked my mum's phone when it buzzed
And then it was the gc for parents
and some mum said
"Temuulen has transferred to a different school so I'm gonna leave the gc”
And Indra just started laughing menacingly
I asked whether she doesn't like Temuulen
She said
He's annoying
Indra: "Bro is genderless”
<Media omitted>
Ah you're cycling again
Have fun babe
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
cutie
Done
Bra is now 10x more sexy
Which isn't saying a lot cause it was not sexy
Ah fun
Proof?
This is pushing it but it was obviously the point of you saying that so I'll bite
Pushing it as in pushing it in terms of not sending nudes?
Yeah
And as such I will not be offended if you're uncomfortable and don't want to back up this claim with evidence
Mhmm
null
You know when people like swallow in cartoons?
That's me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Alex
You're really hot darling
Thank you honey
Maybe would look better without it
But  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
You'll have to find out
Looking forward to it
Mhm
<Media omitted>
Gonna go swimming
Little bit hard but that's ok
If you flex another muscle is goes down
Because the blood goes there instead of to your dick
Oh damn
That makes sense
Have fun babe
You alright
Mishy  :double_exclamation_mark:

Hackers?

Security cameras
Some random guy watching
Thanks for the erection darling
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  you're welcome
There's no way it's high enough definition, and using that is totally a crime
Nobody was around

Bare minimum achieved

I like causing your erections
Sorry
Emotional rollercoaster much?
If we were in person rn I'd worry that I'm pregnant and that's why I'm so emotional
Mossy monster  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :ogre: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Are you going to get copper thing?
Tbh
I think just condom and pull out is statistically good enough
Mhm
I think I should eventually
But like
Getting it isn't going to make you any less stressed 24 7
But that's like
0.01 x 0.01 = 0.0001
so like 1/10000
And it will take us a while to get to 10000 sex sessions
Mhmm
I think so too
At least 3 months for that
Lmao
You want to have sex 111 times per day?  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Assuming we get 4 hours of sleep everyday
We have sex 5.5 times per hour
5.55
We'll try our best
Lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Babe
When we get to London
Baby
Mhmm
I want to take all the tube lines in one session
Like keep changing
Mhmm
Why's that
Sounds sort of fun
And end up at some random place
and then explore
Yeah  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I wanna try all the tube lines
Let's go to a random tube station
Yes  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ill like exploring with you
as much as you'll like exploring me?
Then we can get dinner at some random little place
Maybe not
yesss
that's gonna be so cute
Should we schedule other bits of our sex life before the 25th
What do you mean
Like  are we kissing on day 1
Ah
Maybe let's not schedule that ?
But also I feel like we can't have a full blown makeout session
Yeah
I feel like that leads to thing
Yeah
But like, what are we allowing ourselves before 25th
Am I holding your boobs through clothes
Lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'd say you can feel me but then you'd get horny instantly
I'd live
I think that's fine then
Wdym by feel
Skin
Skin
Right
Is mutual orgasm on 25th or penetration
uhhhh
mutual orgasm?
idk
We'll see?
omg also
You've seen sex education right
Yeah
I am terrified I have something like Lily
Weird fantasy or lesbian?
What  :loudly_crying_face: 
No
The vaginismus
What
I forgot
She tries to have sex w a guy but then clenches up
and he can't enter her
And then she talks to Jean Milburn
Ah right
I think it's fine
And she's like "oh you have vaginismus that's fairly common”
Have you ever tried putting fingers inside
like physically cannot
Have you seen my nails
Can your reach that far
Idk cut them?
Use a bunch of pencils?
Back of a comb
What?
Hmmm
?
That sounds v painful
The back of them
Not the sharp bit  :loudly_crying_face: 
That was mostly a joke
Yeah I figured
It's curable
It's LIT
Have you ever used a tampon?
lmao  :loudly_crying_face: 
No
Mostly because I am terrified of it falling out and toxic shock syndrome
Toxic shock?
It's a bacterial infection which can lead to death
Terrified of bring too tight and too loose  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Oh
If you keep it in for longer than like 3-4 hrs
That's not good
mhm
Don't die mishy
But also people have said it's more comfortable after you get used to it
Alex
Earbuds?
Mhmm
One second
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: 
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Mishy
I'm gonna cry
I really really like you too
You're so sweet
You're so sweet  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm very happy about that
I really am going through an emotional rollercoaster today huh
Little bitty
But it's okay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I really like you
I can't wait to be in your arms
I can't wait to have my mishy in my arms  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm gonna feel so safe
I'm gonna bury my face in your shirt
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I can't wait mishy
Yeah
I'm gonna wrap my arms around your chest
Mmmm
I'll stroke your hair
Slowly close my eyes
I'm so so so looking forward to it
I'm gonna cry I really want that  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
How am I not gonna PDA with you while we're w Saulet and Gaurav  :loudly_crying_face:  Like I need to at least head on shoulder yk
That's fine
If they wanna freak out they can freak out
Although
There was very little head on shoulder with Gaurav around
Like almost none
Most of it was on gauravs India trip
I mean there was that one night
Where Gaurav was wearing sunglasses in your room
<Media omitted>
Yeah but that's only a little
Fair I guess
I'll be too comfy on your shoulder though
And I'll want more
Ahhh
I'll want more either way
You'll have to hold on
:(
Think you'll get horny from lying on me
is that a question or a statement
Question
I don't think so
I'll just be like comfy
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Yeah
Alex
Alex
Help me
Mhmm
What's up
Jiguang Yu texted me  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
This is a crisis
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I came back from the bathroom
What did he say
I saw whatsapp notifs
I was like
Mish
It's fine
"Yay Alex!! My favourite person ever”
What does he want
And then it was not Alex
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
It's not a big deal I'm just exaggerating
But seeing his name on my screen did make me go "oh no”
He's asking if I got any info about making a poster
Just say nope sorry
Here
You can forward this
Nope nothing yet, sorry
There you go
I'll reply to him in the morning
Because otherwise he'll reply instantly
and I have no energy to reply to him again
Babe

But then I'm gonna get to wake up with you

wearing the same stuff the boys wear for uniform
so i was like wtf

Do teachers wear the uniform?
Also sorry  :loudly_crying_face: 
Idk how I slept so quick
No
Yeah it's impressive honestly

How are your grandparents
No worries darling
They're good
My grandpa kept telling me about various people who started various companies
^ like people he doesn't know
And also talking about some of his former students
or my extended family
????
Ok he got a cake from the cake company that Ganaa interned at
Largest cake company in MN
My grandpa's a huge fan of this company
<Media omitted>
the bear is white chocolate btw
He bought it?
Yes
Aww that's LIT :double_exclamation_mark: 
And then he started telling me about the owners of this company
How they graduated in Germany
Started their business
and everything
Then he compared them to the owner of a different cake company
Why does he know all the company lore
I don't know  :loudly_crying_face: 
Then he started telling me about various people and various things they do
Hahah old people  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Today is my grandma's unofficial birthday
I've told you this right
The story of it
??? No
They didn't record people's birthdays
Not sure till when
And my great grandmother told my grandma that it was a day that the children went to school
Oh yeah
I know that one
And so we decided to make it the 1st of September
And my mum's like "it could really have been any day kids went to school  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: ”
Do they know how old she is
Yeah
They record the year
Right
That's funny
<Media omitted>

 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sisters back?
How was school for them
Yeah I picked Emulen up
Her new teacher is 29 apparently
She first told me 22 and I was like "no way” and then she was like "29”
They got lollipops
Before we left we asked Indra if she had her lunch card
Indra said "probably”
Then came back extremely hungry bc she didn't have it
57 minutes
<Media omitted>
Hahah

Patient
I like you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
You're girlboss

They need to verify my student status
<Media omitted>
 :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face: 
i dont know though
It's being super dodgy
Was like this last year
It's fine

idk what i'm supposed to do
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Have you talked to Saulet
Also
Yes
She's panicking
Told you so  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
She's at this exact stage
And panicking about it
That's pretty far in
Copium
What happens if she doesn't get a room
I'm p sure she did
<Media omitted>
Nice
It's v weird tho
She's probably bing chilling
It's lit
I'm on call w her
 :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream: ?
It's not confirmed yet
<Media omitted>
They need to confirm her student status
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But that's it?
And then she needs to continue
and she hasnt had any
confirmation
So she's freaking out
and mine just went through cause they confirmed my student status
ages ago
and they didnt confirm hers through the portal
You deleted this message
Okay but as long as she is confirmed except the student status
She's bing chilling
As long as she's a studnet
She didn't get any confirmation of her reservation
Saulet had a whole army of ppl trying to help her
 :frowning_face: 
I think it's fine
But she's still mega stressed
ngl I would be too
But I think it's fine
I think so too
You're living at Nutford  :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark:  :double_exclamation_mark: 
We have two chances to not be near someone we know

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Walks to UCL together
Everything together
Ok maybe not everything because we cannot be one of those couples who can't be apart
At least not in the long run

I'm so excited darling
I just want Saulet to get her confirmation  :loudly_crying_face:

What school are your sisters at
They went there to ask the principal about rumours that she started a "charity class” where tuition fees were x8 for kids who didnt get in
Lmao what

Stopped them and refused to let them into the school
And broke their equipment

He's getting death threats

3rd and 4th years have taken online exams for 2/3 years now
and they don't wanna switch it up in the last year
I'm gonna kms
I'm not taking 3 analysis modules nvm
I'm changing multivariable to math eco

This message was deleted
This message was deleted
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I keep waking up
I really like you Alex
^ This is not the secret
Hey

1 sec
56 pounds for airbnb
Okay
And 74 for flights?
mhmm
im looking at train tickets
ok babe
thank you  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
its kind of expensive  :loudly_crying_face: 
25 pounds per person for round trip
12 pound train ride ? not horrible I guess
 :loudly_crying_face: 
my dad is driving me to my sis' school
we need to get to the airport at like 5-6am
bc flight is at 7:15
trains don't run that early
so I think we have to stay overnight
or get an uber
oh wait they totally do run that early
idk what I'm talking about lmao
ok
I think we bus
because to take the stanstead express that early we need to take a night bus to liverpool street then take a really early one
and that adds up to about how long the bus straight from mabrle arch takes and we can just sort of pass out on that one
so I think its chill if we do that
and then we can take the stanstead express back? but idk maybe we just take the coach again at that point
oh wait its not cheaper
because its at a god forsaken hour so its expensive
but oh well
I can't book that far in advance tho for the bus
so we can wait on that
but I think we take the bus from marble arch to stanstead for 16 pounds (kms)
then we take the train back
yeah but we can book that later
agreed!
Okay
Right
Gotcha
Lmaoooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That was a turn of events
well at least she didnt yell at you
Mhmm
Interesting dialog we had
Yeah
Lmao
Also
If we hadnt been interrupted
I was gonna ask you to show me the flexing muscle thing
to make it go down
Ah
Not sure that'll work
Because of constant _stimulatuon_
Oh does it only work in minor cases?
Like trying to put out a stove fire with water, will just keep lighting back up yk
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok I'm going to breakfast ttyl
Lmaoo
Okay
Have fun babe
<Media omitted>
Uhh
Ok what do guys do then
Are you just gonna walk around w an erection now?
Is there a way to hide?
When they want to get soft while talking to gf?
It's down
I'll explain later
Okay
Also
It was really throbbing  :loudly_crying_face:  my god
But anyways
Thank you for planning  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
I owe you 74+56=130 pounds?
I was flexing it for you
That makes more sense
Thanks babe
Since I was hard for like 40 minutes straight as soon as my gf's boobs go away it'll just go away
It can't maintain for that long

There's been ejaculation like once
or twice
idk
for you?
Yeah
Orgasm is kinda just when the intense build up of tension is gone
and like not in a "oh it stopped way”
but like in an "omg” way
mish
alex
i have no diea what you're talking about
sorry
Ok
So basically
When I'm close
it feels like everything is going numb
and it keeps going
and going
like it feels like i am vibrating lmao
Kind of like pins and needles
but like
not as awful
And then that tension gets released
mhmm
thats an orgasm?
So like
if it goes in a good way
like a relief way
I consider it done
But if it goes cause I change something up (e.g. position of fingers or pause for like even .3 seconds)
it kinda just goes back to being normal
without it feeling v good
you're like back to square 1
yk
no i dont haha
okay
but
does that make any sense  :loudly_crying_face: 
i guess
I meani dont know what its like so
Mhm
i guess ill take what you say
I don't know what it's like for you either
But
I remember you saying
"my penis feels good for a few seconds”
yeah
thats about it haha
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  okay
much less involved
mhm
I see
I feel like I should buy a vibrator
oh yeah
If I had one w me during phone sex it would make things much easier
that'll be fun
but its like
13 days  :eyes: 
then hopefully it'll be easier
copium
can't hurt tho
mhm
We'll see
oh
banger birthday present actually
Lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Alex
You're v funny
I like you
thanks  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh my god I am exhausted
In like an
I had an orgasm
typa way
Ugh babe
What did I do to deserve you  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'm _so_ much work
its okay darling

You're so kind to me  :loudly_crying_face: 
mhmm

only for you :)
I'm gonna start crying
mishy
please don't cry
But like in a good way
You're so patient with me
In a way that nobody has ever been patient w me
Like I'm genuinely thinking about it
I don't think anyone has ever reassured me and my anxieties more
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Like everyone just tells me to get over it or tells me I'm being dumb (which tbh, fair)
But like
You're so patient
You're so good to me  :loudly_crying_face: 
Like more than I could ask for
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  just for you dalring
but also
you need to worry less  :loudly_crying_face: 
I know
I know it's a lot
and a lot of genuinely ridiculous things
and I know it can get too much
And it's fine if you just say "Mish stop it” sometimes
But you're already so much more patient w me than anyone else
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'll be there for you  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and I thikn you're trying to chill for me
and I appreacite taht a lot  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

You didn't listen to any songs by baatarfly did you
Nope
Who's that
mongolian rapper
I just checked instagram
He's in a lot of controversy rn for sexualising school girls
Mhmm
 :loudly_crying_face: 
He wrote a song
About
School girls?
"girls put your uniforms on”
I'm not sure whether he actually meant school girls but it can be interpreted this way
the song is called uniform
And then he's like "start your lesson”  :face_vomiting: 
Oh
Was about to say
Advocating for clothing  :relieved_face: 
But yeah
Is he cancelled
Yes
Feels pretty hard to get cancelled in Mongolia
i mean
Teacher just sexually harasses students and ppl don't care  :loudly_crying_face: 
my social circle is pretty liberal
So my social media will show stuff like this
Mmm right
i checked the yt vid
Although
The comments are like
Nene being a school girl and thirsting after her teacher
Also a little sus
"These dumb feminists are gonna complain now”
I mean I think it's relatively common to have a crush on older ppl like I knew at least three girls who had crushes on their teachers
And the problem is w older people going for younger people
 :loudly_crying_face:  girls get ready for your lesson  :loudly_crying_face: 
Fair enough
There's this girl
That makes infographics
About social issues in Mongolia
and they're really good
She studies digital art at nyu tisch school of artsp
I just sent you one on insta
Oh wow
Very cool
Why does everyone in Mongolia go to nyu
idk
There's so many people at Nyu
Like the guy I was in further maths with goes to nyu shanghai
????
What does that mean
they guy who i had further maths with
now goes to nyu shanghai
Yeah got that
i didnt properly have it with him
because he's in the year below me
What does nyu Shanghai man
Mean
Nyu has three main "branches”
Nyu Stern in new york
Nyu shanghai
And Nyu Abu Dhabi
^ which is where you can take any major
????
They also have a bunch of campuses around the world mainly for study abroad
It's called new York
Oh Nyu london is right next to ucl
That's not how it works
??????
Yeah I found it
And I was like "oh cool”
That's so silly
They're not the only uni that does this
Ok
I'm gonna sleep now
university of utah has a korean campus
Okay
Good night babe  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Goodnight  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :white_heart:

They all hate me tho  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
i'm really tired but i also heard a very intense tiktok audio
Babe
Can you check something for me
what's the last tiktok i sent you?
I accidentally sent Jean a bi playlist  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok
Lmaoooo
why is Taylor being mean  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh no
It remains
I unsent it on my behalf
but I dont think you can unsend tiktoks
What do you mean
You sent her a playlist on tiktok?
<Media omitted>
this tiktok
Oh no
That's quite obvious
Well
I mean
Straight people can have bi playlists right
My league icon is bi flag
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Are you ok
i think so
i said it was meant to go to someone else (it was not)
?
so i hope it seems like i have a bi friend
and i'm being an  :sparkles: ally :sparkles: 
You meant to send it to her?
No
I didnt mean to send it to anyone
I was saving it for myself
Then just be like oops meant to send a different one
too late  :upside-down_face: 
i am dumb
oh my god
It's fine I guess  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Uh
 :skull: 
Oh no
I think it's fine
but also
spiraling
fine as in nothing bad will happen
:((
because this is not what i wanted  :upside-down_face: 
Mhmm
I'm sorry darling
Were you planning on telling her at some point
I was not really thinking about it
At all
Right
as in
the topic "telling jean about bisexuality” never crossed my mind
like
not in a "i will never tell her way” and not in a "i plan on telling her way”
i was just never thinking about it
Yeah that makes sense
Not the most fun or important topic to dwell on
also cause we have never spoken about crushes at all
except for her teasing me about you
at some point
Haha right
like genuinely this has never been touched upon
Oh well, this isn't that bad is it
what do you mean
Do not want Jean to know
I feel like this kind of makes it sound like her knowing or not knowing isn't a huge deal
i get that
but like
i havent thought about it since like may
and just
ah  :loudly_crying_face: 
as in it makes it sound like her knowing isnt a huge deal
but it kinda was
pre may
Because she told you about that person who was also bi
not bi but lgbtq
she felt bad immediately afterwards
she was like shit shouldntve said that
but my trust issues went  :chart_increasing: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
it ended up being fine bc said person is completely out
Are you nervous about Hiroki knowing
but she didnt know that
yes
Right
oh no
Well
You can probably play it off
At least will enough that she can't be sure
Well
 :loudly_crying_face: 
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
i am just upset
not quite upset
uneasy
Mmmm
I'm sorry darling
It'll all be alright
She's not going to leap to any conclusions
also my god thank god it was just jean
and im just thinking what if it had been someone else
i would be losing it completely rn
Who else do you send tiktoks to
hang on
saulet called
i am distracted
maybe thats good
Mhmm
Yeah definitely good

Hahah
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Omg
mhm
I was so jealous of that piano guy you worked with at graduation
Cause of Ioe?
Lmao I follow him on instagram and he's doing the same thing at these graduations again
No
Oh
Me
Because you
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Babe
The first thing this guy said when I told him my name was "Mish the bish”
Lmao
I don't think you have anything to worry about
*had
You're not worrying now
is why i said had
Mhmm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
i logged into her portal to add lunch money
Also my mum is really not having it today
She keeps going off on us three for literally anything lmao
Lmaoooo
 :frowning_face:  :frowning_face: 
I'm sorry darling
What's wrong
Cutie
Why's she frowning so hard tho  :loudly_crying_face: 
she does this when she doesnt wanna talk
 :frowning_face: 
I guess it's kinda like you said that I completely close off if there's even one person I'm not comfortable w
it's fine
It happens
 :loudly_crying_face:  poor baby
My mum is v pissed that it took me a while to add lunch money
 :pensive_face: 
Like  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  I need your bank details for this
And she yelled at Indra for an hour straight bc she was dehydrated
Indra or your mum
And Emulen for just general Emulen behaviour
But  :frowning_face:  :frowning_face: 
Indra was dehydrated
Poor children
Because she's super clingy
And it gets bothersome sometimes
But baby  :loudly_crying_face: 
I mean I can get that
But at the same time
My mum said I became lazy because I haven't baked anything since I came back  :loudly_crying_face: 
Baby  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaoooo
You were thirsting for baking tho
I know
isk
idk
It's a mix of
"I'm tired”
"I have an internship”
"The kitchen is always dirty”
Have a bf  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ie I need to clean the kitchen then bake then clean the kitchen AGAIN
And this
Cause most of my baking is late night "I'm craving something”
And my late nights are always with you
 :loudly_crying_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
and I'd rather spend my late nights talking to you because I'd have to stop if I were to bake cause then they'd wake up
as they always sleep w the door open and the kitchen is not a separate room but joint w the living room
what are you up to?
Watching China league
how's that going
exciting?
Mhmmm
2-2
ah
RNG won games 1,2

I thought no queue tho
it's not for queuing
its just there to show parents not to go past this line
lmao
it's p empty now
most kids are done an hour before most days
so 1pm collection is super full
??
Why
2pm collection not that full
and 2.30pm collection v empty cause im late
why to which point?
Finish at 130?
Is it like a kindergarten
No?
kindergarten finishes at 5pm
school finishes at 1pm ish most times
???
starts at 8
My school always finished at like 3
i am about to throw hands at my sisters school
？
their teacher decided to have 2 lessons in a row
one lesson going into lunchtime
she hasnt eaten all day
 :enraged_face: 
i called my mum and told her to complain about this
Poor baby
their entire class missed lunch??
Yeah wtf
Isn't it almost 2 now
This is some Mish behaviour right here
about to be 3
And nobody's eaten??
At so
All
mhm
i mean emulen has
cause her teachers reasonable
Mhmm
But the other half
indra
yoy
this is literally withholding food??
from 10 year olds???
wtf is wrong w this teacher
Poor kids
Are they eating now
im gonna warm up some food from yest
Oh do they normally have school lunch
Yeah
So they have a lunch break where they go to a cafeteria and they just didn't today
Lmao what
Yes
They're literally all shepherded to go to the cafeteria
Like
Everyone gets school lunch
no boxes and stuff
So it's not like anybody in this class was eating their snacks during the lesson or whatever
 :frowning_face:  hopefully people complain
no fr this is outrageous
also
I'm gonna make pasta
Yay  :partying_face: 
So it might be like 20 more mins till I call you
Aw
But at least your sisters get yummy food  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

This is such an interesting combination of messages
Hahah
Yeah that's quite a spread
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Bro that's such a good one
My comedic genius shocks even me sometimes
cant beat the original tho darling xx
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Emulen is asking me for help w Mongolian hw
You didn't do it as a joke darling
Little does she know all I'm doing is googling
Hahah whaf
They're asking for the name of a baby elephant
Like you know like sheep - lamb
Can't ride horses, needs to Google Mongolian hw, foreign bf, ?
what's the equivalent for elephant  :loudly_crying_face: 
In Mongolian? No idea
I'd guess calf? But I have no idea
There's a word just for the elephant
wtf  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok see this is what I'm on about
It's a calf
I didn't know the words for "drums” until the age of 14
In toooooooo smart
English or Mongolian
because these are the things that you learn like once
and then never again
in primary school
And in primary school I was too busy learning conversational Mongolian
there are separate words for all the animals
I guess it's kind of like the way you call a group of animals a lot of different things
like
School of dolphins
Mhmm
Ok now she asked me one which wasnt obscure
Tiger baby
<Media omitted>
Bambar
<Media omitted>
Did you know a group of crows is a murder
I think I've heard that
Huh, good to know, not totally convinced were speaking German right now tho
<Media omitted>
I assumed it would translate directly
(English 4th language)
Babe
I want fries
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
this is a problem
see
i can make fries but then it's have to make enough for everyone
and 4 portions is too much effort
Just chop chop
Agreed!!
Frying is the annoying part
it takes
Ages
The frying isn't more effort you just do it
Get a bigger pot
And throw all of them in
ok food time ttyl  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
we dont have enough oil for that
not for me
ok
ttyl
Emulen just said "let me try to name all your friends”
She's like
"Saulet, Jean, Munkhjin, Ganaa, Alexander, Alex”
Completely unironically
She thought you were two different people
I miss you babe
Haha
Understandable
Saulet behaviour
Miss you too darling

honestly i swear
if someone told me the only vegetables i could eat were broccoli and mushrooms id be chill
the bits where the spices mix into one fried bit are so good
i would say
Broccoli is the best
No doubt
this is relatively healthy but it's not
Broccoli?
it is a lot of oil
this
I mean vegetables  :woman_shrugging: 
mhm

Yeah
Jean isnt back either
mhmm
so just the two of you
Yeah
Gaurav already saw me like last week
Mhm
maybe he'll be out somewhere
who knows
maybe
unlikely
I also have a feeling he wont want to third wheel
So we're really gonna have to pull ourselves together
will we have to go back to paddington/hydepark for saulet
Assume so
mhmm
ukraine set 1 25-16
wow
agains the netherlands
Damn
thats a big upset
Against tall people??
well no
Ukraine is very tall
And isnt ukraine bad or is that just the women
Ukrain wouldn't have been competing had russia not been DQ's
DQ
Right
nothing to do with russia out ukraine in
just coincidentialy they were next in line
and they scraped into top 16 to play the knock out
and now they're beating one of the top teams
Yeah you've mentioned this
But I thought that was just the women's team
no idk about womens
Mm
Ok
I see
womens is after men ared one
kazakstan is playing
it took me a while to get that you meant "are done”
Kenya?
Dominican replublic

this "soon" thing is getting increasing closer to being true
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I feel like Gaurav might not want to third wheel
ok this might actually be bad:
is it bad that I hope he doesn't want it enough so that we get some alone time?
like
it's a reasonable thing to want as someone in a couple
but i feel like im being mean
im cold
need alex to warm up
its reasonable

Doesn't look that bad
Hi babe  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
My sister just texted Jean from my phone
i know
I was tracking you  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Food now?
The place looks good
Mhmm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :skull:  :skull:  :skull: 
Good thing she didn't go to our convo
I know right
Wtf
So much incriminating shit
Omg
.
Please
She would have seen the sexting
I cannot live w anyone seeing this text
Thank God
I will die and then die again if she sees this
Yeah fair
And she'll be traumatised
And when she's my age she'll be like
Yeah for sure
"I used to steal my sisters phone when I was 10 and saw her sexting her boyfriend”
LMAOOO
No but that's genuinely what Ganaa tells me
During one of the summers her sister came back from college
She found some ~very spicy lingerie
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That's very traumatizing
How did she get into your phone
<Media omitted>
and she went up to her mum and asked when she'd get to wear this stuff
omg
Ims
*kms
double suicide ?
Bet
Apparently it was unlocked cause it saw my face
And it stays unlocked for a bit
And during that bit she opened my phone and texted Jean
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmaoooo
Also when my phone pinged cause of this
I was away from the table
and she grabbed my phone
and I was terrified it was sth phone sex related
Just now?
Yes
I ran into my room and locked myself in
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
Babe  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

Sorry darling

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
I'm always craving some food
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :frowning_face: 
Stealth mission  :relieved_face:

Omg
I'll survive
We should go to McDonald's at night
Then feed each other our mcflurries
Oh my god

Hahaha  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
If I heard anyone else say that  to their partner I'd be like "ew gross”

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Please
I am waiting for Indra to sleep
So I can finally continue
god
V horny
Legit
Oh wow
Still
the "good girl” on call took me out
Not the whole time to
Lmaoooo
no
It's too easy honestly
I have reason though
1) Boyfriend v hot
I'm going to also ignore the fact that good girl woke me up enough to pack
when I left the uk
Fair enough
Oh yeah lmaoooo
That's was funny
Sh
Lmao
My sister just came into my room and said
"It's not my bedtime yet so don't tell me to go to sleep” without any prompting
unprompted
that's the word
So I was genuinely terrified she connected my phone's whatsapp w her desktop
Hahah
Yeah she'd have a bigger reaction if she did that
Yeah
I'm v horny
I swear this is such a curse
Always horny
Mhmm
Poor mishy
I still feel so attacked by that tiktok that was like praise kink <=> parents didnt pay enough attention
It's shower time
okay
have fun
In a bit
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I feel like you weren't thattttt neglected right
Until age 10 no
I mean once sisters came along I can see attention lessening
My mum does not remember anything that was going on when I was 10-15
And if my mum doesnt remember
Right  :frowning_face: 
neither does my dad
I was chill w it tho
But also lead to bad avenues
Yeah
Like getting wet when I call you good girl
Like talking internet friends out of suicides
Lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh yeah that
I guess it's good but also not fun for a 12 yo
But also having cute interment gf  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm not gonna complain about it cause it wasn't bad but it was definitely not good
I just feel attacked cause of the praise kink thing lmaoo
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
But now
When does Indra sleep
I have a boyfriend  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

i said later
she said urgent

it's just not
meant to be
:(
I might be able to call you to help
if I have 45 minutes to spare
lmao
thanks babe
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
you're the best
thanks  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Saulet is at Nutford again
 :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face: 
I am still talking to her
Orgasm really seems unlikely
just when it was starting to get _really really_ good
Okay
Hung up
Babe
Can I call you
for any purpose
not right now sorry babe
That's okay
She's gonna be in the flat
right
Apparently only one person signs the contract for the flat
thats pretty cool
and then the other person is "the partner”
so Jenny signed it
therefore skipping the UoL doesnt want Saulet issue
So Saulet is the "partner”
So she's gonna be at Nutford  :partying_face: 
It's tooooo lit
 :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face:  :partying_face: 
Mhm
God
Okay
Now that that's settled
I am gonna continue
don't think I'll be able to be very involved this time darling
That's okay
have fun babe
Gonna be thinking of your dick  :white_heart: 
oh
good to know
So I'll have fun for sure
 :white_heart:  have fun
please cum for me darling
Will try to  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
lmao

<Media omitted>

or 4 later
oh wow

are you being a good girl
and touching your pussy for me
<Media omitted>
glad to hear it darling
Can I call you
<Media omitted>
please
<Media omitted>
But basically
I went down a rabbit hole
Of what ifs
Even tho it wouldnt have worked out
But
There are vibrators
that you can control using apps
that would've been fun
like long distance
Of damn
That would be sick
Wtf
I know right
If we're still together next year
Most of them are hella expensive
But some are like
That's a lit goodbye present when you go to Germany
$40
Fr
Please
Let's be
Okay  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
Like
look at this
Oh damn
for him & her apparently  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
That's insane
These ones are the high tech ones
Like
$100
<Media omitted>
^ this is the male toy btw
Also I was not looking for sex toys initially
I was looking for lingerie  :loudly_crying_face: 
And then there was also a bunch of bondage stuff
maybe later
???
Oh control vagina contractions
Right
Yeah
Oh?
Not opposed
Mhm
I know
Ooh
Would be fun for you to pick sth out at some point
I'm thinking far ahead
But  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Mhmm
I think just a normal cheap vibrator may be in order if you still take forever tho
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
We'll see
Also if I do it's not gonna be because of you it's gonna be because of me
by this i meant lingerie
Ok
Enough w sexy talk
 :loudly_crying_face:  darling
Im not that insecure, but I appreciate your consideration
Oh yeah  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
But like
I don't really get lingerie
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Because you could just not wear clothes
sorry babe
Less sexy potentially
Because like teasing or whatever, I can see the appeal
mhm
But not like 50£ less sexy yk
gotcha
And like, it's coming off anyway  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :writing_hand;_light_skin_tone:  do not wear clothes
Mhmm
got it
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I havent asked you about your day much babe
How was it
Pretty good
Just cycles
Cycled
mhm
My chain came off
Which it's done plenty of times
Oh no
Right
And it's fine?
But normally it comes off on the outside and you just put it backnon
But this time it came off on the inside
Also what are you gonna do with your bikes
Like
Are you gonna keep it in LDN?
or
oh no
And got stuck inbetween the gear and the frame
So we had to speand forever putting it back on carefullt
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Then we got to the top
<Media omitted>
aww
Then went down fast  :smiling_face_with_horns: 
also you're matching w your mum!!
That's so cute
Oh yeah
I am  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
My babe
Mine
Mhmm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
I want more of this
But we dont have any more broccoli
and it's late
The bikes were rental
<Media omitted>

A little bit
Mm
Going back to sleep?
Or calling your gf?
Either way's fine
Babe
Mhmm
I really like you
What's up
I really like you too  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
And I want to make out w you
Mhmm
That sounds good
Let's make out
<3
<Media omitted>
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why this picture
There are cheese bake crumbs on my hoodie
You're so cute  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I'm in puddle mode
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
Aww
Babe
I can't wait for cuddles
<Media omitted>
Yeah
My mood constantly changes between
I want to be in his arms on top of him
And
I want his head on my lap
That's good
Let's do all the moods
Mhm
I'm so excited for dates
Mhmm  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Me too
Little venice
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Ducks !
Italian place!
Ducks!
I am v excited for the Italian place though
I feel like I won't be able to finish it thop
Though*
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
I will probably be able to help
yay boyfriend
Yay
Hey Alex
I really like you
That's good
I really like you too
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Call gf? Mayhaps?
Your pussy and your crack
?
sister and dad are back
dad's changing a light bulb
dad has finished changing a lightbulb
should be leaving relatively soon
?
:)
Emulen has hella cash
still here
fr i will send a pic later
sorry babe
mum's calling
it is v annoying
he's still here
yet i am going to pick up my sister
rather than him
i should be leaving in like 3-4 mins
w no rush at all
ok
out of the building
call me when you can
nvm
dad picked me up
Oh
Ok
see
this is what i meant
there is genuinely no point of me going
if my dad is literally going to be there
Moral support  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
he's now waiting
omg
apparently shes not done w school
wtf
!?
Did you guys get the time wrong
No
The teacher's keeping her there for longer
???? Again
This time to hand out books
I asked her when she'd be done
She like
"It's gonna be a while”
I said wtf am I supposed to do
She's like
Stay here
????
I don't want to
Isn't this supposed to be done on school time
Not after school time
I know
It's bullshit
I don't like this teacher
Ugh
Mongolian schools
I told her I need to go home and cook and do work
We have decided that I'm gonna go home
This is pointless
You're just gonna walk?
Yes
 :face_with_rolling_eyes:  this is dumb
She's gonna go home by herself
Oh wait what
after she's done
Is it close enough for that?
I thought the point of being picked up was for safety, is it just for encouragement
No
She wanted me to help carry her books
It's like 10 mins
Ah right
and it's within the apartment "village” bounds
so no major roads
Oh yeah that's nice
So it's fine for Indra to go alone
So why did your dad drive  :upside-down_face: 
because that makes it into a 2 min drive
He picked Emulen up like that
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
and he was leaving our apt anyways
I ran into him outside
Mhmm
Almost home
Okay
Let me call you back
Looking forward to it  :smiling_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

I had to fix sth else in code
So not that much progress
 :frowning_face: 
What happened
<Media omitted>
Ah
Mislabelled things
That's a lot of letters
It is
My smart coding girlie
You can read my report when I actually finish it
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

<Media omitted>
Callers?
Please  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
I'm almost back home

Or is it too distracting
Call me
When you get home
Okay
Idk why but you just replying "call me” is so attractive
call me please
Oh your phone died
<Media omitted>
come back :(
Please
what's going on?
Bro
I can hear you
Speak to me
My parents just arrived at the boba place
 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face: 
No way you repeated the question
When I obviously read jt
 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes:  :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
Yeah
From this point
I clearly read your question
You were asking it as if I didnt read it
Don't change the intention post facto
Nah
I don't believe you for a second
What're yiou up to now
Btw
The first time I saw my parents
I kinda knew I was gonna bump into them
Since I saw them on maps
But this time
They just wandered into the boba place I was at
No
Just coincidence
What're you messaging your supervisor about
Also
The cashier speaks mandarin
So my mum orders something
And they started chatting
And she was like, I saw your son come in 2 minutes before we opened
Then leave
Because I went to get lunch
lmaooo  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
She remembered me
 :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face:  :neutral_face: 
Probably report structure
Speak to me darling
With your pretty voice
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Oh okay
Calm dowb
It's all gonna be okay
????????
How are you stressed about this
You knew you wanted to do this
This is litterally what you signed up for
Nothing has changed
And you're like
">.< Im so neveous >.<"
Mish
If you don't want to do it
Don't do it
If you want to do it for rec letter purposes
Then just say yes
It's not that deep
I'm genuinely shocked you're managed to be stressed about things like this
You've already made up your mind on this
How are you managing to spend more mental effort on soemthing you've already thought about to completion
you called me sweetie  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Yes I did
Now answer
Honestly it would depend on how you react after I wake up
Tf you mean ?
I'll be like  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: yay my gf  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Sorry for coma  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
lmao
That feels appropriate
Ethan's graduation's about to start
Oh cool
Ay
if youre like "you sorta asked to be crushed”
I'm not gonna draw any conclusions
I'd be like "what the hell”  :loudly_crying_face: 
But I know for a FACT that if Louise crushed Ethan's lungs and put him into a coma for two years they'd stay together
Just saying  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone:  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
oh my god
Do you want me to ask him
I'll do it
Istg I will
Oh my god
During his graduation  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  ??
Lmao
If you're super apologetic about it and sweet I'd probably stay
I'm v down bad you see
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Thanks darling

I'm proud of you
I'm legit gonna stress out

and ask me about
I will wake up and feel awful
And like
I could probably pull through
But
Just tell them the truth, you have a perfectly legit reason
I'm just so tired
I mean if I were to do it I'd be so stressed tomorrow
He told me it's ok if I just show my figures and talk about it a little
But like
I'm just so exhausted
and he's giving me an out
Mhmmy
You should take it
Yeah
He said
Do whatevers right for you
to tell him by the end of today
which is v soon lol
I'm proud of you darling

And I'm tired
Doing what's right for you is hard, this is really good

regarding the trans thing, tell me if you ever don't want to be called man or guy or boy idk you seem like mostly cis atm but if anything ever changes just tell me  :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart: 
I was v confused as to why you said "mum”
My god there are so many opinions regarding the firing of the principal
I just like dresses I'm pretty sure  :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: 
Okay  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Really? Kind of feels like there are 2 options
It's like
 :thumbs_up:  or  :thumbs_down: 
Hating russians
• On the side of russian teachers, but against principal
• On the side of head teacher who she worked with for 25 years then fired right before his retirement, against principal, against russian teachers
• telling the whole school to shut down
• On the side of principal, against russian teachers
Lmao
This is so silly
There are genuinely so many stances
The head teacher was so scary but I came to realise he was just a very stressed man
 :frowning_face:  :frowning_face:  :frowning_face: 
He's actually really in it
I like him
And they fired him
and his daughter (who I don't like who was my German teacher)
his daughter also blamed cmbyn girl's class for her miscarriage
???????
I think you mentioned this
Why are they all so insane  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
His daughter also made me teach her classes because she was tired
Right
Just have mishy teach everything
Mhm
I was in 10th grade
and I taught 11th grade
which tbh fair
cause german 1st lang
But also
<Media omitted>
Wtf  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
misclick
but also
I like doing heart hands @ u
<Media omitted>
She was also fatphobic
She kept bullying this guy in my class
This guy being the guy who was down bad for me for 7 years
She told him not to eat
And was surprised when he fit behind his desk
Back to sleep?
Breakfast
Ah okay
 :face_savoring_food:  :face_savoring_food: 
Have fun babe  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Wtf how'd you do that
iphone
 :loudly_crying_face:  wtf
I also cried once during the break due to an exam (that her dad made) and she mockingly asked me "who hurt you” while laughing and I was this close to saying "your dad”
Well at least she got fired  :relieved_face: 
Yeah
Oh well
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Also I should really shower
my scalp is becoming itchy

Have fun  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I feel like it's harder for you to send slutty shower pics
Anyway
Have a nice shower
It is
may attempt though
Sounds good  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes:  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
null
Oh

 :loudly_crying_face: 
You're so pretty

<Media omitted>
wrapped up
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  so cute
I like wrapped and unwrapped
Haha
mhm
Wholesome though
At first  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Yes
Wholesome indeed
^ not just cause of internal misogyny
Also I think it would probably just be good to be wholesome for a bit
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I wanna hold your hand
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Please do
My mum told me to epilate the hairs on my hand
???
what does that mean
English or please
<Media omitted>
Epilate
Like
there's this machine
It looks like an electric razor
but the wheels kinda just spin
and it acts as like
a lot of tweezers
and it grabs onto the hair and pulls it out
Fancy
I was like "I dont have an epilator” and she's like "you can use mine”
Does it hurt
Feels like it would
Yes
A lot
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I once plucked the hairs on my fingers
end result was satisfying
but also
my god
a lot of work and a lot of pain
Mhmm
I sometimes do that
Just to random leg hairs
Or face hairs
I'll just pull
For fun
mhm
It hurts but :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Oh you know what I do for face
I grab onto a bunch
w tweezers
and
Smile v widely
and it pulls it out
And bc youre smiling
I just shave it
It's like you dont feel the pain
hair grows back more coarsely
If you shave
Like it doesnt actually
But it looks like it is
cause the end is blunt
So I don't do that
My hair doesn't grow
So
cause I cannot keep up w shaving
Fair
I don't need to  :relieved_face:  :flag;_Taiwan: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
I also need to wax my legs
I have not done that
in like
2.5 months
warming up food now
If you wax do you not need to shave for longer?
Yeah
But I don't shave my legs ever
I have shaved my legs like a total of
4 times in my life I think
I wax like
once a month usually
Right
Doesn't that hurt
Can I do it
Feels like it'd be a fun bonding experience
It does
We can wax each others legs
but also
its not that bad
you just rip it off quickly
Do you ever wax your  :cat_face: 
and it feels like ripping off tape
no
my god
Why not
i dont want to know that pain
Is it more painful then legs
much more painful
Why not just shave legs to avoid pain  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
also youre not supposed to wax
down there
yourself
you need someone else to do it
like
professional
grows back more quickly
and looks thicker
<Media omitted>
leg pain is ok to deal w
Yoy
Alex
<Media omitted>
I want a break
Why not break now?

"you should take a break for sure!”
I think he's onto something darling
Yeah
You can't tell me you were actually constantly stressed during the time between be leaving and your internship starting
Your project was such low stakes
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  my girl has such bright leg hair, mad attracted rn

 :loudly_crying_face:

You can just ignore them  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

My mum just said
"The worst people have no sense of humour”
I agreed
and she said
your dad has no humour
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
My mum's talking about how she doesnt like dry humour and she said "then people go haha at things that just arent funny”
And Emulen said
"What if they go hehe? is that better?”
lmaoooo
She's so cute  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

est dept when?

On plane now
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

She could say emulen is funniest and you're funny too
And leave it at that
But she had to go for the throat  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
At least you're not least funny  :relieved_face:

"You have humour, you laugh at everything”
Then I started laughing

"see you're even laughing at this”
I got a very unhelpful reply to my email
I asked if the report has to be super duper formal she said "10-20 pages”
That's a lot of pages

Thank you for the orgasm
You're really good at dirty talk
I cannot form proper words when you do that
Also please keep denying me stuff
That drives me crazy
Absolutely
Mhmm
It's my pleasure
glad it is
Because when I dirty talk you need to wait till I finish and till I recover from the orgasm for it to be any good  :loudly_crying_face: 
That was so good oh my god
It's okay
I can't get over it
it was so good
I'm normally horny enough from making you cum it's short work
Thanks babe
 :white_heart:  :white_heart:  :white_heart:

Fluid squeak???
What does that even mean
as in
Do you have a pad or something? Because I think I was hearing hair
no
Like being rubbed
Maybe duvet
Maybe you heard my hair on pillow
it was v wet
and I could hear like it squeak when I moved it
No
it being my fingers
Because the peace of it changes
When i
Tell you to change peace
Pace
hmm
I don't think it's pubic hair lmao

I was gonna say "no I wasn't I just like this rock band” then I remembered how I discovered this band
https://youtu.be/K3aQx8-tpCc
I found this song because they performed it at Victoria's secret  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
So I guess it was horniness
Jail
It's just naked people in this video
The song is super horny
The song is a banger tho gotta admit
Mhmm

The rock band
Italian
The one I kept talking about
So they first became famous through X factor Italy
Where they covered a song by the struts
Mhmm
And I was like !!! omg the struts
And it's also horny
Then I found a video of them performing with the struts
And I was like omg!!! the struts and maneskin
Ok the song itself isn't that horny but the maneskin version is because the singer pole dances while he sings it but I discovered the song just through the struts so I'm gonna say it's not horny
Right
I definitely 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

You can think I'm mega horny

Good to know
Did Gaurav send the "edge” photo w ref to edging
Idk  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lmao I will not be able to keep it together when edging is mentioned in a "haha” context
in the friend group
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Given the fact that you have almost edged me
It totally will come up
Not true
I'm always eager for you to cum
Since it takes forever
That is why I say almost
It's really just teasing
Like yesterday
When you were like "stop”
Oh my god
That really worked
Mhmm
Now I'm horny again
I knew it would
Lol
Lmao
Sorry babe
It's ok
Will do something about that eventually
Not now
You genuinely had me squirming there
/ I am defo down for edging
Maybe not proper edging cause that's too much work
Mhmm
but like
I mean
Having you go slow
Would do it
Idk
When
No but sometimes slow is good
Uhh
In a few hours maybe?
2-3 hrs?
I've asked to go slow again a few times
not recently
Yeah
I don't get that
Are u tired or smthn
No  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:

Sometimes it's just like
I'm going slow

and it's like
pleasure meter resets?
idk  :loudly_crying_face: 
?
Like
Ok
Whatever you say mishy darling
I believe you
Slowly hitting a good spot
Like every second

Going fast may not stimulate it just the same?
And I miss the old feeling?
Okay fair

Am I just turning myself on here
I can't wait to do it very poorly myself  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:

<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
aww babe
oh no
I am in a dumb situation
I was in a sticky situation a while ago
Uh
So I realised
Both of my sisters and my mum are super light sleepers so if I showered they'd wake up immediately
So I decided not to shower
But I still wanted to wax cause I know I wont have time to wax tomorrow morning
So I clean my underarms whatever right
Uh turns out I dont have the right wax and I only realise after using the first strip
I am in pain
Then I'm like I need to get the wax off but I dont wanna waste the oil sheets that come in the package
Um so my dumbass me is like
Soap should work
It does not
So I am there with my literally sticky armpit
And I use an oil sheet
while freezing my ass off standing there topless cause my mum opened all the windows close to the bathroom
back 2 shaving it is  :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
today is just not the day 4 me i think
 :loudly_crying_face: 
mishy
I don't thikn I get it entirely
the wrong wax doesn't work?
As in
then you try to use soap to get it off
and that doesn't work
so you have soapy waxy painful hairy airmpits?
it's wax for legs
And arms
like
much less delicate skin
right
Indeed
 :loudly_crying_face: w
I am shaving tomorrow morning
has problem been resolved
May tomorrow be a better day
Yes via oil sheet
 :folded_hands: 
Are you back home?

 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
This song makes me think of the night you told me you liked me
cause of the line "everytime I see you I think of telling you but I don't know how” (even tho I was never gonna tell you (how would that even be possible when i was so deep in denial))
i cant believe you were like "I need to sort out my feelings before next year"

Yo so
I couldn't shave today
Because
Indra has used my razor
and I don't have an extra razor
This sounds overdramatic but I swear if you see the state of this razor
It is very gross and the blade has oxidised and
I'm not gonna say anything bc it's probably her first time using a razor
Hi darling

Just about to leave  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Would've been here sooner
But mum made us go to a store
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Then Indra had left her phone in the car
so I had to walk back to the garage
Which is quite far
It takes 10 mins lmaoo
 :disappointed_face: 
Oh well
 :goblin:

Idk
It looks funny
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

You're so cute
1 turn away from slipping out
lmao
<Media omitted>
Oh no
That's horrible
Would hate it if that happened
lmaoo
Also from the fact that my mum said this is for when I'm travelling
<Media omitted>
I assume my mum thinks we're not dating
???
Why
She was like
"It's better to wear this to sleep than shorts when you're travelling w people”
I assume she's referring to Nürnberg
Mhmm
I mean
because that is the only travel plan I've mentioned
You'll want to wear something
key being
"than shorts”
like the paper thin shorts that I wear to sleep
Oh
Well
Those are pretty good
But the PJs are v cute
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
And we were talking about the queen
And I was like
Oh yeah I'm trying to book an Italian place
and then I realised I couldn't book it on her funeral day bla bla
Mhmm
and she's like
Very subtle darling
why are you trying to book an italian place
"i want italian food”
Lmaoooo
"with who?”
"alex”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
She's like hmm
Hmmm
Also she made the shorts comment after I told her about the Italian place
And then she said
 :loudly_crying_face: 
"I think your souvenirs are not good enough”
There's no way she doesn't know
Or at least very suspicious
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
"Your friends are sending you T-shirts and you're getting them small stuff”
I'm sure they are darling
I'm like
Don't listen to you
Lmaoooo
I'm like
That was less of "fun and quirky souvenir shopping” more of a "gift for mish” typa thing
^ Actually what I told her
Mhmm
Gift for Mish
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Thank you darling
And then she's like
"You should buy this plush camel”
And I'm like
"How am I going to get a plush camel for 5 people”
And she's like "obviously not, just your closest friends”
and she's like
"oh right everyone's on the same level”
Riiighhhhtt
Is a plush camel as good as gifts get
Fairly lit tbf
Haha
But it's lit
<Media omitted>
I mean you saw what I got for others
I think it's fine
A plush camel??!?? :exclamation_question_mark:  :exclamation_question_mark:  :exclamation_question_mark:  Its toooooooo lit  :fire:  :hundred_points: 
Not a plush camel  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I forgor  :skull: 
Lmaoo

<Media omitted>

Because there are two options for the second one
and whichever one I don't choose goes to Jean
not maths related
I can help
What are they
But I don't wanna spoil it for you  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's ok  :relieved_face: 
Actually
I think I know
Okie
It was v obvious
I looked at the things again
Doesn't surprise me that much
Misheel "overthinker" Ganzorig
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
No need
I need to keep bullying you about it
Until you stop
Even though this situation isn't entirely applicable
But  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :loudly_crying_face: 
You can keep bullying me as long as you show me lots of care
like
80% hugs cuddles kisses whatever 10% cute words 10% bullying
maybe ratio isnt entirely accurate
But yk what I mean
Mhmm

<Media omitted>

 :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
I didn't get it initially

 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
It's like
My nationalities
We have too many
Yeah fr
And everytime one comes up we're like "yeah!!”
So none of them are that strong
"that's us!!”
Yeah Ganaa was like
"He doesn't seem super American if his parents are British and Taiwanese - doesn't he just live there”
I'm like
No he has an American passport, grew up there and has an American accent
True
 :loudly_crying_face:  :flag;_United_Kingdom: 
Sorry babe
It's true
God save the king
King
Look at it this way
Yoy
 :nauseated_face: 
Lmaooo
Imagine you arrive at nutford, immediately start playing the british national anthem
Some freshers walk through the common room thinking
"wow this guy is really preparing for the funeral”
Lmaoooo
I don't think so
or the new king
Whatever
Idk
Coronation
I get to relate to both American boy & London boy
Right

It's lit
Mhm
And everytime California comes up

By the time I graduate I'll have spent less than half my life in America
7-17
I'll graduate at 20
Gotcha
Baby  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I was totally romanticising graduating at 20 when I was 16 tho

"20 with a master's degree in maths?”
Romanticising
20, 22 no diff
Agreed

How was it
I only caught the last 10 mins
My mum and I were talking about how Mongolia had just gained independence around the time she was born
not proper independence
Independence from the Chinese
Wow that recently?
Yeah 1921
Did y'all celebrate 100 years
Mhm
Actually no
So you know I say Naadam is in July
The thing that I thought was in Hyde Park
It was cancelled due to covid
After a lot of protests
Oh  :frowning_face: 
Because they wanted to keep holding it
Wait is Naadam independence day
Kind of
Not totally
?
It's been held way before then
It was a holiday before hand and China was like as a present you can have independence
But it commemorates independence
The dates werent set properly
Oh yeah
Nobody knew about dates back then
Didn't record birthdays  :loudly_crying_face: 
I'll be home in like an hour? Maybe more

How is gaana
Ganaa was half drunk
She went on a hike w a friend
Then drank one (1) beer on top of the mountain
and I think mixing beer and exercise was not good
And then she got coffee to wake herself up
I think everyone is a light weight
It's one beer  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Then I think the latte and the beer didn't mix well
You're actually not a light weight
Surprisingly enough
And she was genuinely falling asleep
Hahah
After a coffee
And feeling sick
I had to support her
And get her into a cab
Poor gaana  :loudly_crying_face: 
I feel v tired after one gin tho
I'm not like
Drunk
But I'm just tired
and reduced attention span
oh yeah she said
Really? I don't notice that
"Hi back, take care of Mish”

Also
You don't have to help all the time
I know darling
Last time I didn't help you went for 75 minutes then gave up tho
So  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
You just end up helping a lot I don't wanna make you feel like I expect it  :loudly_crying_face: 
I mean honestly orgasm isn't the main goal always
I mean
orgasm = good
but
Shouldn't you? Sort of my fault your horny  :relieved_face: 
And I like helping
good =/> orgasm
orgasm => good**
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Okay babe
Can't wait to give you head
^ unrelated related thought
Mhmm  :relieved_face: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:

My god
I really like you

 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I really like you too
I can't wait to cuddle you
Also yoy
I really like you topless
For sexy reasons
and also wholesome reasons
Hahah
Sexy reasons
I'll be topless for you a lot then
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Like I just wanna explore your skin
not like
I KNOW
in a super horny way
SAME
I just want to see
and touch
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I just want to know your skin
Does that make sense
Like I want to be like "ah yes this spot”
yk?
Like
be familiar w your body
Yeah more or less
That sounds good
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
I just really like you
Is it sleepy time soon darling
Mayhaps
I really like you too  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Not now tho
Maybe half an hour?
isk
Oh have you started your period yet?
idk
No
I'm so annoyed
Genuinely
I'm gonna be menstruating on the plane
Mhmm  :frowning_face: 
kms
Sorry darling
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Poor mishy
Menstruating while walking to Nutford w my suitcase
this is not that bad
but also
Ugh
Menstruating while I see you
 :loudly_crying_face: 
It'll be tailend of it though
Assuming it starts vaguely soon
And that'll be a hard stop from us doing _things_
Yeah
Look on the bright side!
But also
On the days that I'm on my period
I sleep in a v particular way
it's not that particular
But like
they're the only nights i'm able to not move
 :frowning_face: 
Like I need to lie on my back for the whole time
or else there's a mess
Rip
cause if I'm sideways
Yeah
Can imagine
and stomach isnt that great either
Right
So maybe I'll just lay on top of you the first night
Hahaha
But
pressure
Mmmm
is also painful
See
Ok I'll wait for it to be over
This is a dilemma
for the heavy flow days at least
At least it'll make our friends feel better
We're not spending nights together
Lmaooo
Just start soon
Do they have to know whether we're spending nights together or not?
Yeah I want to fr
Punch your uterus or something
Idk feel like they'll find out/ask
find out = Gaurav
Lmao
True
I mean if we show up to breakfast at the same time
lmao
They'll probably just come to a conclusion
But also
Ok fair
How do we stop hanging out with them
Like okay *we're* gonna go now
Uhhh
~have sex~ cuddle
Right right
^ nothing of this sort will be mentioned
I'm sure it won't
But like
They'll know
If we leave
Yeah
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Dilemma dilemma
idk
It's fine who cares
Cause we usually end up hanging out till 1am  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah
You'll be jet lagged tho
Agreed
and then going back and just collapsing
Hahaha
mhm
for sure
Yoy
and after I'm super jetlagged
I will go to sleep
and you'll join me (?)
Oh
Also
Sorry to bring up horny again
But I think I will enjoy slapping  :loudly_crying_face: 
Also
I can't wait for soft kisses
Like
gentle
and everything
Be gentle w me
As we fall asleep
I'll be gentle w you
Yeah I know
Mhmm :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
It'll be great
I kept thinking about how you were like "I'll slap some sense into you - then again you'd probably enjoy that”
And I was just like
That's so hot  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah
Little venice night please?
Okay I'm really going through a bunch of emotions here
Mhmm. :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Like I'm about to cry thinking about how good a boyfriend you are

Mishy darling
Should you maybe try to get some more sleep
I'm awake
and all I can think about is you rn
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
You're so cute
Oh my god
This is deja vu
I had a dream like this
Last year
like
I don't think this is a dream
Summer 2020
That's two years ago
I had a dream that I was about to leave Mongolia
2021
and I had a boyfriend
Omg
and I told him I couldn't wait to see him
and that he was all I could think about
Man
Who's this other guy
Gonna hire dream Alex to beat up dream mish's bf
I don't know darling
Oh
This is embarrassing
so uh when I was figuring out my sexuality
I was on yt a lot instead of porn sites
???
and it would be like
soft porn
Lmaooo
and ok wait
there's this one woman
who made content
^ dominatrix
and like
I had a dream like 2 nights ago that she was like "I'm done with this I'm getting married”
LMAO
so I checked whether she got married
She did not
You're such a sub darling
Hahah
Okay good, the dream bf must be fake then
I watched her content like 7-8 years ago lmaoo  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yeah hence embarrassing
Mishy  :loudly_crying_face: 
Watching dominatrix soft porn on yt at 12  :loudly_crying_face: 
Lesbian*
Right
The thing is
It was not lesbian  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Got distracted trying to figure out sexuakity
So I had to listen to her
Oh no
Alex
This is so embarrassing
talk to like these men about their small dicks and whatsoever and I was like hm yeah
????? Lmaoooo
Because there was not much lesbian dom soft porn content on yt in 2013/2014
Like none at all lmao
Right, hole in the market if you ask me
hahaha
And I could never watch M dom because there's no way to tell whether these men were actually super misogynistic or just like doing it for the vids yk
I'm not misogynistic I promise :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I know
You told me you like being called a slut
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I knowww Alex it's fine
Ok but lowkey
Link me some of that fem Dom stuff
fr?
also
this woman is german
But she makes Eng content as well
And then I discovered her German content
She has a lot more German content
on her website
But you need to actually contact her
Nah I can't take that seriously
to get access to it
Lmaoo
the german stuff ?
or femdom in general  :loudly_crying_face: 
How'd I go from talking about deja vu to femdom
I am gonna kms
Alex
This conversation can never be known to anyone
No matter what
Genuinely my deepest shame
(at 12)
lmao
The German lmao
Fem Dom is hot
Mhm
It's not that bad darling
The thing is they were POVs
and then the women always talk about torturing some guy's dick
or not povs
there's usually some like
interactive moment
where they talk to the camera whatever
And then they always talk about some guy's dick and 12 year old me would just be like  :sleeping_face: i hear nothing :sleeping_face: 
Oh wtf
Idk about that
That's a bit much
Lmaoooo
You wouldn't pretend a little bit
"Oh yeah step on my dick please" -12 y/o mish
hahahaha
no
that's so funny
but also i just searched femdom on yt
I think I may have found the funniest video ever
It's so bad
i think it's meant to be bad
But it's so funny
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZUySNZNbWo
I genuinely spent the whole time laughing
41 seconds
That's obviously a joke
Yes
But like
It's inbetween all the actual femdom videos
It's so funny
"I wouldn't eat any meat but especiallt not from you”
lmaooo
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Ok but also
most of this stuff is age restricted obvs
Right
And 10 year old me created a yt account and I put my age as 19
because 18 would be too suspicious
So
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
My god
Also I am not ruining my yt recommendations by watching this is in anything but incognito mode
I think it took a long time for them to get out and I was worried my mum would see at some point lmao
Lmaooo
yt thinks I'm 29
Clever clever
Mhm
Haha good call
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
V sub
?
like
similar things would pop up in recommended
for a while after
Oh you didn't use incognito back then
No because they're age restricted
So you have to be logged in
Ohhhh right
lmao  :loudly_crying_face: 
okay
Uh
embarrazzing
stories have been told
I will now pass away
Happens  :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
mhm
ok
Alex
Yes mishy

I'm so happy  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Babe?
Babe

But like a nice burger place
Maybe not
First date night is hard  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Started my period
Am now in pain
Bro
My dad
I swear to god
He's like
"you should go get a manicure”
?????
I don't understand him
and he keeps pressing me about things
I'm like
I'll book a hair cut time soon
And he's like
I'll book it for you
????
Why is this necessary
It's tiring
And it's also v annoying bc he and my mum are not fans of yk, speaking to each other
He's like
How much did your sister's new shoes cost? let me send money
I'm like
I don't know
I wasn't the one who bought them
Then he's also pressing me about why I didn't answer his calls (I was in the bathroom dealing w my period)
I am in so much pain
I do not want to pick my sisters up
But I have to
kms
Genuinely cant
And I have to go to grandmas to eat
And if I show any sign of tiredness or pain my grandma will worry herself sick
I am in so much pain oh my god
J am so nauseous
I just stopped like halfway to the school to sit on the bench
Sorry darling my phone died even though I plugged it in bc my adapter wasn't working
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  poor mishy
I'm sorry babe
???
 :face_with_rolling_eyes: you're an adult  :loudly_crying_face: 
Can't you just tell her your on your period?
lol update
i practically collapsed in front of my sisters' school
almost
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Darling
my uncle had to get me cause i was blacking out
MISH
Please  :loudly_crying_face: 
Can't your sisters just walk home
i am in bed
i had a few screaming fits
it has never been this bad before
like in my life
ever
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Darling
I'm sorry
its so bad my grandma and my dad talked yo each other
and indras actually caring for me
Omg
Are you going to make it out
Indra? Caring for you?!
ok
anyways
i found a semi comfy position
and am gonna nap now
Ok darling
bye darling
Talk to you later
i gen started wailing in the elevator
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Poor mishy
I'll gently hold you to make you feel better
In 3 days
by then it should be fine
That's good
my dad put his hand on my back and even the slightest pressure
Tell me when you wake up
was too much
like
i started screaming at him
If you're up to it I'll try to call you
okay
sleep time
Sleep well darling
<Media omitted>
Hi darling
Hi there
I am awake
I'm out with my mum
Mhm
Have fun babe
<Media omitted>
also the prices have increaded
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  thanks darling
I'll conceded to being an American for the joke
Mhm
My uncle also made my grandma come here
Like he dropped me off
and then picked up my grandma and dropped her off
Meanwhile
I am screaming in my bed
My grandma was about to call an ambulance
and also it's very hard to talk to my grandma cause she's hard of hearing
So I kept trying to tell her it's my period
and periods are called "body medicine” if you do a literal translation
so she was like
"Your whole body aches??? Let's get an ambulance”
I'm like "nooo body medicine” she's like "you need more meds?”
I feel bad they made like lots of food because I'm leaving and invited me for lunch meanwhile I'm losing it
Oh no  :loudly_crying_face: 
Don't feel bad darling
Blame your uterus
 :loudly_crying_face: 
My god why was it this painful
My dad asked me if I'm always in this much pain
I was like no lol
and then he just like rubbed my back and I was like "this is making the pain worse” and I was screaming at him
lmao  :loudly_crying_face: 
He was like
Let's go to the hospital now
I was like
I cannot move
But babe
I have looked at countless places in LDN
idk where to go
Poor mishy
Yeah the task of choosing is not easy for us
Indecisive couple
lmao
My mum thinks my appendix may have burst lol
She's like
This happens frequently cause women just think their appendix bursting is period pain
not this
appendicitis
idk
Oh no
That'd be bad
I've heard about that
Does it feel the same as periods
idk
is the thing lmao
My mum has told me to go to the hospital tomorrow
Are they going to scare you into going to the hospital
and not to take any more painkillers
Like
Ok usually
period pain is like
I am whining quietly into my pillow cause I'm in pain
I was just screaming today
But usually when I have period pain I don't walk this much
I mean
If it's never been this bad
Has it been close to this bad
Then maybe it's a hospital angle
It's not sending  :loudly_crying_face: 
Like when I was 14 15
I threw up a bunch of times (didn't do that this time!)
But like my god I genuinely just like collapsed on the ground in front of the school
 :loudly_crying_face:  darling
I wasnt even sitting on the windowsill that was like perfect height to sit
I was just on the ground
Maybe it's a hospital angle?
and Emulen sat next to me and I told her to sit on the windowsill
Mhm
mayhaps
But also I think it's fine
But my mum was like
I need to know you don't have appendicitis before you get on that plane
She was even like
Maybe you should push back your flight now
 :loudly_crying_face: 
That's a bit extreme
I was like
I don't want to  :loudly_crying_face: 
Maybe if you actually have appendicitis
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: 
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
My darling
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
At the sports store again?
Mhmm

<Media omitted>
Mhmm

<Media omitted>

Ok
Thank
My dad just booked an appt tomorrow
at the hospital
Right
Everytime I'm about to leave Mongolia
Something happens
Last time it was the false positive LFT
This time potential appendicitis?
 :loudly_crying_face:  :face_screaming_in_fear: 
yoy
What are you up to now?
Babe
Do you know what
Looking for food
What is it darling  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
You're the highlight of my day
also lmao my dad called and he's like "how are you feeling?” and i was like "ok” and he went
"what about your hair salon appointment”
"i'm not going”
Awww  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Thanks mishy
"you sure? it's at 7pm and it's only 6pm now”
and I told him
I already called and cancelled
He's like you should go to the hospital and also hair salon
Lmao
Yeah
Right
No but like
Genuinely
Your smile is so cute
Esp when you say slightly out of pocket things
Like earlier when you were like talking about my uterus making more lining
Haha sorry babe
I just like look at you like "what” and then you just like laugh and smile and apologise and it's so cute
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Gotta get that deadpan look somehow  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
omg
I remember you telling me like
Right after you left
You were like

But I was seriously considering
Just to be able to say
Taiwanese brown sugar tea just like my boyfriend
Cheese?
 :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Also I'm pretty all boba is Taiwanese

And there were some like
"Thai green tea”

Also
Indra and Emulen were v cute
Launch time  :face_savoring_food:  :face_savoring_food:  :face_savoring_food: 
Indeed
I was sitting on a bench in the sunlight cause that was closest to the entrance
And Indra just trails off
I tell Emulen to go get her
And then Indra's like "I found a shady spot you should sit there”
And then we're in the elevator
I'm like crouching on the ground w my eyes closed
And then I look up and see Emulen having gotten her key out of her school bag already, prepared to open the door immediately
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
I collapsed onto the bed and they ran to open my window to let air in
 :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  what a cutie
They're such sweethearts  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts:

 :exclamation_question_mark: 
My flight now departs at 12 and arrives at 3.30pm in Franfurt
My FRA LHR flight departs at 4.00pm frankfurt time
Uhhh
This is a problem
I am not going to make it to this one
Um
Wtf
Oh it's not lit
Kms  :loudly_crying_face: 
At least Frankfurt to London flights are relatively cheap?
Yeah
<Media omitted>
They literally changed it today
wtf
Wtf
That's bs
2 days before
It was supposed to land at like 2pm before
This is what I meant when I said Mongolian airlines don't give a fuck when I left
Yeah
I didn't believe you sorry darling
You were right
Also phone may die very soon
So sorry if I ghost for like an hour
That's okay
Coming back home in an horu?
Give or take
Okay  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
Hi there
Hi babe
Hour and a half*
My darling
Auto correct going crazy nowadays
mhm
indeed
Also my sister hears my morning convos w you
I didn't think I was loud
But she was like
At 5am she was talking to either Saulet or Alex
heard*
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Oh no
Lmaoooo
At least it's talking
Not
Yk
yeah
fr
she said
i heard her talking
she cant make out what im saying thank god
Yeah I mean that's expected
But still  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
"Saulet or Alex”
Genuinely just my boyfriend or my bestie are the only two options
lmaoo
Fair enough
I mean I talk to Jean a lot too but I never call her
Cause she's sick
and doesn't want to talk
Still?
Poor Jean  :loudly_crying_face: 
How did the exams go
Her symptoms are getting _slightly_ better
emotionally she's exhausted
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Why always Jean
Deferred alg4 nt
And
she said Methods 3 was ok after she finished but she's not sure about it
but now she's convinced herself she's done awful bc she discovered a bunch of mistakes she made
Analysis 3 I didn't ask but it seemed to have gone mostly ok
 :loudly_crying_face: 
She was just worried about one thing
And it wasn't that big
Do you think she'll be around next year
So I think she's actually fine
I don't know
 :smiling_face:  :smiling_face: 
She's still considering taking a year out
I think it'd be good for her
Poor Jean
Honestly same
She's only gonna be more stressed
Plus that way we can graduate together  :slightly_smiling_face:  :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: 
haha
She said the only reason she doesn't want to take a year out is me
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
Awwww  :loudly_crying_face: 
Because online exams + general stress
That's cute
It is
not good
Mhmm
also I think her parents aren't fans of her taking a year out
 :woman_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
 :man_shrugging;_light_skin_tone: 
Any callers
And exam results come out during fresher
s
Right
Give me 5 mins
So she has to decide whether to re-enroll before
Or no?
I mean she can interrupt within the first few weeks presumably
that's what I did at St A
Right
Yeah you don't need to re-enroll until the 28th of October
Feels like they'd be pretty cool
and also in the case that she forcibly has to interrupt there will be some procedure in case (which will not happen bc she's passed all her exams)
Chill
Mhmm  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
I'm sure she did
Jean is smart
Yeah I'm p sure as well
Okay
Call ?
Mhmm

because it is easiest to distinguish friends by nationality

Mongolian airline said not to
bc there was a high chance of the flight being delayed further
and the heathrow flight was delayed itself it was originally at 6
and they were saying the mongolian flight might arrive at 5 or sth
ok fair enouhg
"we might be delayed xd :P"
plus now you get to play with purfume
its lit
I am tired of playing w perfume
 :loudly_crying_face: 
<Media omitted>
My eyes are v red
idk what happened
they've been red since the flight
Also so many people our age were crying on the flight or while leaving their families at the entry
I wasnt gonna cry but then I had tears in my eyes cause there was this boy in front of me and his grandparents were there and they told him to study well and have fun and then his like 2-3 year old brother was there crying "don't leave brother”
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
the brother was full on wailing
screaming "older brother”
What are you up to babe
ugly :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :face_blowing_a_kiss:  :face_blowing_a_kiss:  :crossed_fingers:  :crossed_fingers: 
Also the audacity of indra
lmaoooo
no need
you were playing with perfume for like an hour darling
They were red before perfume
that many people going to europe?
for uni i presume
also

"our age"
LMAOO
Alex  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  oh no
but also like 20 year age gap? thats impressive
Not really
M is 20 years older than her brother
My cousins are 20 and 16 years older than their youngest brother
I have a friend who's 18 years older than her brother
fairly common here
doesn't M have a sister 10 yaers older than her
ig not here bc i'm now in germany  :loudly_crying_face: 
Yes
so a 30 year age gap?
But that's on her maternal side
The brother is her paternal side
She has no full siblings
The older sister is her half sister on her mum's side
right
and she has 3 younger brothers on her paternal side
but her mum gave birth to children 30 years apart
thats crazy
or no?
oh wait no
No
Yoy
Babe
I am tired
poor Mish

They were really terrified and we thought that it would be safer if Joyce, I and another guy who's a friend of Joyce all go to paddington to pick you up

Actually
Wilfred and Gaurav are still shaken up

Babe
I saw Noah yesterday
I was standing at reception and he was drinking inside the lounge
So I waved at him and he came out
and the first thing he says is
"Hi haven't seen you in a while, heard you're in a relationship now”
Lmao
In character
Yep
This is while Hiroki, Gaurav, Wilfred, Joyce and Joyce's friend who carried my suitcase are all standing there
Lmaoooo
Did they follow up on that comment
Or just leave it
nope
I was like
Nice
"maybe"
Joyce may know that I'm in a relationship  :loudly_crying_face: 
due to uhhh
yk
things
like
phone sex?
She didn't hear that
Stop lmao
I know
I'm joking
She said 412 is empty
But I didn't get 412
What did you get
Guess where I am
420!
218
Right above Eric
Nice!
Second floor!!
 :smiling_face: 
Eric's old room that is
Right
Oh
Near my old room!
Cool!
Nice spot
But Gaurav was saying most ppl got their old rooms
returning people
Right
Which makes me think Eric is still in 116
Lmao I remember Matias complaining about ppl having sex on the 2nd floor above him
How could someone who isn't returning get their old room
Good point honey
He heard me laughing while playing league with Leo one
Once
Thin walls  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
That's why he wasn't that bothered by Saulet's constant giggling
and screaming
from constant tea guests
Right
He was like "There's worse noise above”
We'll just be quiet  :grinning_face: 
Mhm
If we do

I have forgotten most things from 2nd year  :upside-down_face: 
I'm sure you're not alone darling
Hopefully
Jean is here
And is not taking a gap year
 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
She has classes nonstop till 6pm today
Like literally run from one class to the other
 :grimacing_face: 
bc they havent changed her modules
 :loudly_crying_face: 
So the new modules and the old modules just in case they dont change them
lecture's starting again
ttyl babe
Okie have fun  :kissing_face_with_smiling_eyes: 
Got here in time to wait in huge crowd
Now sweaty
Kms
2:03, almost in the door
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
At least Sobolev didnt yell
<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>
First row???
Mhmm
There weren't that many other options
But I'm down
mhm
I've recognized exactly 0 people
As it should be I'd say
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
5 minute break before he continues talking at you?
Mhmm
He seems alright so far
Don't be fooled by him
He's good at explaining
But he's nasty
as Jean says
 :loudly_crying_face: 
Because the exam is hard?
No generally he's not a nice person
Oh lol
He doesn't seem that bad
He yells at people who are late
He calls questions idiotic
And worst of all he makes the worst exams eva
Someone was late and he just kinda glanced at then
I think cause it's the first lecture
Yeah probably
Then again
He made people stand outside during the first lecture
Like he made them stand at the door
There is very little space here
Lecture theatre is basically full
Mm
<Media omitted>
 :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: 
Why online lecture?
Cringe?
Where report
He says
Watch lectures beforehand
The whole thing
Just don't lol
Then the 2 in person hours are problem classes
Oh
He doesn't teach the stuff
So I actually need to get through it
 :loudly_crying_face: 
He says he's gonna do 1h of teaching
Summarising the thing
Manageable
and then we're working in groups during problem classes
and he's gonna come and talk to us individually (pog?)
Epic
There's a group of 4 guys next to me who are all friends
And people come talk to them
Then a group of 4 standing over to my right, inspecting one guys league of legends shirt
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
 :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face:  :loudly_crying_face: 
poor darling
Ok
Me go now
Ttyl  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
ttyl  :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :smiling_face_with_hearts: 
<Media omitted>
What is this
Lmaooooo
Riemann hypothesis jump scare
Actually
If anyone knows someone looking for a room contract private message me please
???
Jean?
I have already
Don't worry
Only problem is he's on the first floor
i messaged 1 minute after this guy sent a message
And I messaged Jean
Oh lmao
I just did
She's in a lecture rn
So she can't do the registration
Is she allowed on first floor?
It's probably find
Yeah I said she'd sort that out herself
Either way there's probably someone from Annex who'd like to switch
And I feel like Jean is ok w a smaller room
 :person_shrugging: 
That'd be kinda lit
Yeah
Smaller person haha
Only problem is she was also late on payment last year
But let's hope they dont notice
If she's taking a contract it's prob fine
Doubt they'd notice
Yeah
Anyway, got fluids to go to  :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :cold_face:  :soft_ice_cream:
