6/21/22, 5:24 PM - Misheel: can i call
6/21/22, 5:24 PM - Alex: No
6/21/22, 5:35 PM - Alex: I think its alright to not be super passionate about everything all the time, like you can't expect to always have a very clear direction for what you want to do and have everything planned out. I get that it can be stressful to not know where things are going, especially when it seems like you've been pretty directed for the last 3-4 years but theres nothing wrong with taking life as it comes. Additionally, maybe having no direction or passion is an issue if there is geniuenly nothing for you to do, but you're still in university, you have two more years to do cool things and meet new people and find out about new things. Finally, you're genuienly a very very intelligent person,
one of the most intelligent people I know and that makes so many more opportunities for you, there's bound to be something that'll call to you. If it can't work for you then it'll hardly work for many other people. So just don't worry about it too much üòÅ at least for now

6/21/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: I am trying to learn how to magic circle

6/21/22, 8:31 PM - Alex: In telling the yarn you said that
6/21/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: oh no
6/21/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: the yarn will hate me
6/21/22, 9:26 PM - Misheel: Omg
6/21/22, 9:26 PM - Misheel: I learned a magic circle on regular yarn
6/21/22, 9:26 PM - Alex: Oml
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Alex: Whoah
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: But it‚Äôs so much more difficult on the fluffy yarn
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: and it‚Äôs not just me
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Alex: üò•
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Alex: You can do it
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: so I‚Äôm thinking of just making a regular circle
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Alex: Special crochet lady
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: No the thing is
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: I do
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: it
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: but then you‚Äôre supposed to pull one end
6/21/22, 9:27 PM - Misheel: and i cant pull the end
6/21/22, 9:28 PM - Misheel: without ripping so much fluff out
6/21/22, 9:28 PM - Alex: üòî

6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Alex: If I'm tbh being honest
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Misheel: for this yarn
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Alex: Idk if it'll be that deveststing if you use normal circles
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Misheel: there might be a hole in the middle
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Alex: Such is life
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Alex: It's like Socrates said
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Misheel: but it still piles up
6/21/22, 9:29 PM - Alex: Life is like a donut
6/21/22, 9:30 PM - Alex: There is a hole in the middle
6/21/22, 9:30 PM - Alex: Idk what I'm going on about
6/21/22, 9:30 PM - Misheel: i think that socrates did not know about donuts
6/21/22, 9:31 PM - Alex: There's no way to know for sure

6/21/22, 9:51 PM - Misheel: but i am also not 100% sure what i‚Äôll be doing
6/21/22, 9:52 PM - Alex: Well what are you doing then

6/21/22, 10:06 PM - Misheel: It‚Äôs very difficult to tell where stitches are
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: It‚Äôs much easier w regular yarn
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: I‚Äôll get used to it
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Alex: Mhmm
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: but for now it‚Äôs just annoying me
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Alex: Do you need to get in the stitches each time
6/21/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: Yes
6/21/22, 10:08 PM - Alex: Right
6/21/22, 10:08 PM - Alex: You can do it üòÅ

6/21/22, 10:09 PM - Alex: No need for that
6/21/22, 10:09 PM - Alex: That's more subtraction than anythhing
6/21/22, 10:09 PM - Alex: Taking away 12
6/21/22, 10:09 PM - Misheel: Depends
6/21/22, 10:09 PM - Misheel: Or is it adding -12?? or if you‚Äôre going from 12 hr to 24 hr
6/21/22, 10:10 PM - Alex: Adding negatives is subtraction
6/21/22, 10:13 PM - Misheel: ok
6/21/22, 10:13 PM - Alex: Why do you sometimes wait long periods of time before hitting me with the ok
6/21/22, 10:13 PM - Alex: Are you thinking of a clever response then giving up
6/21/22, 10:13 PM - Alex: Cheesebakes
6/21/22, 10:13 PM - Misheel: i try to think of sth to say other than ok

6/21/22, 11:29 PM - Alex: But when you first revealed the fact you wrote them at all
6/21/22, 11:29 PM - Misheel: Come back
6/21/22, 11:29 PM - Alex: You explicitly said you *won't* reveal the characters
6/21/22, 11:29 PM - Alex: Totally wouldn't have asked otherwise
6/21/22, 11:29 PM - Alex: üò≠üò≠

6/21/22, 11:30 PM - Alex: Don't know who those people are
6/21/22, 11:30 PM - Alex: I preferred the labour and beck ship personally
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Misheel: cause it was the typical nice girl - hot boy combo
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Alex: But that's just me
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Misheel: lmaoo
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Misheel: but the one in the show was jade - beck
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Misheel: aka mean girl - hot boy
6/21/22, 11:31 PM - Alex: Oh beck is a boy
6/21/22, 11:32 PM - Alex: Nice girl hot boy is embarrassing?
6/21/22, 11:32 PM - Alex: I suppose I would have to watch the show to get it
6/21/22, 11:32 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs kinda boring
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: I wasn't planning on watching it lol
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: i meant the ship
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: is boring
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: in the show he actually kisses her after him and mean girl break up
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: like a few episodes later
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: The logical follow up here is to ask to read the fanfic, but I won't bother, maybe a few years down the line
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: ie tries to kiss her
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: Immediately after?
6/21/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: What a man whore

6/21/22, 11:34 PM - Alex: She wanted to tho
6/21/22, 11:34 PM - Alex: Ugh

6/21/22, 11:35 PM - Alex: For sure
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Misheel: we will not count huaiyi and beatrice bc they know i am not with either of u
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Alex: Do they ?
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Alex: Beatrice does
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Alex: Huai yi?
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Misheel: He just said we have chemistry
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Misheel: I dont think he‚Äôd say that if he thought we were together
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Alex: That counts
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Alex: That's basically they would be a good couple
6/21/22, 11:36 PM - Misheel: I think that just means he thinks we‚Äôd make a good couple
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Misheel: Yeah but Beatrice said Gaurav and I‚Äôd be a good couple
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Misheel: so does that make 4 for both mish-alex and mish-gaurav
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Alex: You're just trying to get your number down
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Alex: Plus
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Misheel: That makes 8 then
6/21/22, 11:37 PM - Alex: I think huaiyi counts for more since Beatrice knows us better
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Alex: Huai yi is just ovserving
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Alex: ?
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Misheel: how does that count for more then
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Misheel: 8 for me
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Misheel: rather than 6
6/21/22, 11:38 PM - Misheel: oh wait

6/22/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: That one looks a little tight, I like the flowy flowery ones

6/22/22, 1:11 AM - Misheel: idk why the slit fixes it
6/22/22, 1:11 AM - Misheel: but it does
6/22/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: I have no idea what you're saying
6/22/22, 1:11 AM - Misheel: Ok I think I get it

6/22/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: Is a slit means your leg is out
6/22/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: And you smile
6/22/22, 1:18 AM - Misheel: it looks better
6/22/22, 1:18 AM - Misheel: because your leg is out

6/22/22, 1:39 AM - Misheel: will always have a grudge ü•∞

6/22/22, 1:40 AM - Alex: "damn candy girl"

6/22/22, 1:41 AM - Alex: Are you going to use your skills to track her
6/22/22, 1:41 AM - Misheel: Mayhaps
6/22/22, 1:41 AM - Misheel: But probably no I dont even know her name
6/22/22, 1:42 AM - Alex: And call her in as your you're dying
6/22/22, 1:42 AM - Alex: When has that ever spotted you
6/22/22, 1:42 AM - Misheel: what if she‚Äôs dead by the time i die

6/22/22, 1:45 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 1:46 AM - Misheel: ok but in relation to this
6/22/22, 1:46 AM - Misheel: i think
6/22/22, 1:46 AM - Misheel: that ‚Äúi think he knows‚Äù and ‚Äúpaper rings‚Äù are sisters
6/22/22, 1:46 AM - Alex: Agreed
6/22/22, 1:46 AM - Alex: Very cutsey crushy as some would put it
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Alex: Paper rings is so cute
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Misheel: the person that said that is v smart
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Misheel: IT IS
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Alex: She is. mega girlboss as well
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Misheel: agreed
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Alex: My fav line
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Misheel: which takes me back?
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Alex: Yes
6/22/22, 1:47 AM - Alex: The one after that but yes
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Misheel: to the colour that we painted your brother‚Äôs wall
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Misheel: or color
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Misheel: since she‚Äôs yk american
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Alex: üá¨üáß
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Alex: She loves a London boy tho
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Misheel: or colour since the brother is british
6/22/22, 1:48 AM - Misheel: but afterglow is truly my bestie
6/22/22, 1:49 AM - Misheel: like paper rings is just like the cutesy crushy thing
6/22/22, 1:49 AM - Alex: Yeah
6/22/22, 1:49 AM - Misheel: but afterglow is relatable
6/22/22, 1:49 AM - Alex: I'm perfectly happy with that
6/22/22, 1:49 AM - Alex: Is it üôÉ has it been all your fault
6/22/22, 1:50 AM - Misheel: idk i interpret it as her saying sorry for a minor argument where she is in the wrong and her worrying about it way too much
6/22/22, 1:50 AM - Misheel: and looking for reassurance
6/22/22, 1:51 AM - Misheel: also she wants him to tell her that it‚Äôs not her fault
6/22/22, 1:51 AM - Alex: What no
6/22/22, 1:51 AM - Alex: The whole point is that it is her fault
6/22/22, 1:51 AM - Alex: And she's sorry for exploding
6/22/22, 1:51 AM - Alex: Accusing him for something he didn't do
6/22/22, 1:52 AM - Misheel: it is her fault
6/22/22, 1:52 AM - Alex: It kinda seemed like she thought it was a big thing, "put you in jail" , "arm behind your back" obviously metaphors but still
6/22/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: Doing Taylor swift lyrics analysis at 2am (GMT) btw haha
6/22/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: (general Mish time)
6/22/22, 1:53 AM - Misheel: good job
6/22/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: But I agree the bridge is very cute
6/22/22, 1:55 AM - Misheel: but when you‚Äôre worried about sth you think it‚Äôs a bigger thing than it is? it sounds like it was a big thing but that‚Äôs how i think of it in terms of ‚Äúrelating‚Äù
6/22/22, 1:56 AM - Misheel: does that make sense?
6/22/22, 1:56 AM - Alex: I don't think it was like a small thing that she blew out of proportion, despite the first line, I think it's more like she accused him of something completely untrue
6/22/22, 1:56 AM - Alex: I realized the literal first line of the song as I was typing rhat
6/22/22, 1:57 AM - Alex: And that's making me rethink
6/22/22, 1:57 AM - Misheel: Hmm
6/22/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Actually I'm leaning more towards you now
6/22/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Because its all me in my head
6/22/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Kinda makes it seem like an overthinking thing
6/22/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: Ok but in your side‚Äôs defense that could be her saying ‚ÄúI thought something untrue happened‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:00 AM - Alex: No but then it would be like "sorry I didn't believe you"
6/22/22, 2:01 AM - Alex: Because I'm imagining like she got suspicious or someone told her he cheated and she exploded and he denied but didnt believe it, but that doesn't totally add up with "it's in my head". I think you're right it's just a little overthinky thing
6/22/22, 2:01 AM - Misheel: I think she got suspicious
6/22/22, 2:02 AM - Alex: Have we switched sides since the beginning of this debate
6/22/22, 2:02 AM - Misheel: ie being close w some other girl or sth
6/22/22, 2:02 AM - Misheel: and she mistook it as emotional cheating
6/22/22, 2:02 AM - Misheel: no but I am considering a different side
6/22/22, 2:02 AM - Misheel: I will always relate to it in a ‚ÄúI am overthinking‚Äù way
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: hopefully not in the og alex way üò≠
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Alex: But that's not the sort of thing you have a big realization that you're wrong, it's more gradual emotional trust thing
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Alex: Neither is it a thing you "put someone in jail" for
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: if they had a fight
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Alex: God we're really nerding out
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: and she didnt listen to him
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: and just ranted at him
6/22/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: we are ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:04 AM - Alex: ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:04 AM - Misheel: and then later she notices how sad he actually is
6/22/22, 2:04 AM - Alex: But agian, that feels like immature behaviour but not something like the jail or arm analogy works, because it's hurting his feelings not accusing him
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: But it really lines up with "I blew things out of proportion now you're blue"
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: Ehhh actually
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: Put you in jail for something you didn't do lines up as well
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: Literary analysis queen here
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: (normal analysis queen too)
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Misheel: Hah
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Misheel: Analysis 3 üò≠
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: Shhhh
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Misheel: ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:05 AM - Alex: Life happens we move on
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Misheel: Ok
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Misheel: But anyways
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Alex: Agreed
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Misheel: Afterglow is relatable bestie
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Misheel: Paper rings is cutesy crushy
6/22/22, 2:06 AM - Alex: Mhmm
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: London boy is my London vibe
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: I Think He Knows is more crushy
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Alex: London boy is indeed a London vibe
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Alex: I think he knows is very crushy but less cute
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: Cornelia Street is nervous crushy only bc of the ‚Äúi‚Äôd never walk cornelia street again‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Alex: Which isnt bad, it's also really catchy
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: Yes
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: not crushy
6/22/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: Telling a story
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: happy in love
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: Crushy? It's quite definitely sad
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: but also nervous
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: sad??
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: Yeah it's like reminessing about old times
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: The whole street is too painful
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: What?
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: No
6/22/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: She says ‚ÄúI hope I never lose you‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Misheel: She‚Äôs telling their whole story
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Alex: Oh wait
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Alex: I'm an idiot
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Misheel: Daylight is such a happy confident song
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Misheel: enlighteningr
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Alex: Haven't heard it much
6/22/22, 2:09 AM - Misheel: ^ pun unintended
6/22/22, 2:10 AM - Alex: Will listen now
6/22/22, 2:10 AM - Alex: Pun unintended means your comedic talent is just naturally overflowing
6/22/22, 2:10 AM - Misheel: ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:10 AM - Misheel: Ok but hear me out.
6/22/22, 2:10 AM - Misheel: Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince is the girl you want to be
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Alex: You'll have to explain that one
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: I understand this sentence may not be relatable
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: But trust me
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: See it paints such a YA novel story
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: And that‚Äôs what you want your life to be like
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: And like
6/22/22, 2:11 AM - Alex: Oh yeah clearly, it's like highschool football games or whatever
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: yk how youd be like ‚Äúid love to live in this book world‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs kinda like that
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Alex: Okay okay I can see it
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: Cruel Summer I interpret in two ways
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Alex: Makes it all seem kinda fun
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: 1) the og way
6/22/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: yeah exactly
6/22/22, 2:13 AM - Alex: Cruel summer I can interpret as a BANGER
6/22/22, 2:13 AM - Misheel: aka just a summer fling where she actually really likes the guy and cant admit it totally?
6/22/22, 2:14 AM - Misheel: 2) the queer way
6/22/22, 2:14 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 2:14 AM - Misheel: because of these lyrics
6/22/22, 2:14 AM - Alex: Ohhh
6/22/22, 2:15 AM - Alex: That's interesting
6/22/22, 2:15 AM - Alex: To be fair
6/22/22, 2:15 AM - Alex: The line after this is "he looks up"
6/22/22, 2:15 AM - Misheel: I know
6/22/22, 2:15 AM - Alex: But still I can see that
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Alex: Did you come up with that yourself or is that an internet theory
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Misheel: myself
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Alex: Bro
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Misheel: that‚Äôs what it reminds me of ngl
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Alex: Go do your PhD in literature
6/22/22, 2:16 AM - Misheel: but i‚Äôm p sure it‚Äôs an internet theory as well
6/22/22, 2:17 AM - Misheel: mostly ‚Äúi dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:17 AM - Misheel: is like the typical thing about same sex couples
6/22/22, 2:17 AM - Misheel: one is out the other isnt
6/22/22, 2:17 AM - Alex: Mhmm fair enough
6/22/22, 2:17 AM - Alex: But I love you ain't that the worst thing you ever heard fits too
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Alex: For similar reasons
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Misheel: yeah
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Misheel: false god was one of the first songs on that album that i listened to on repeat
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Misheel: i never talk about it now
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Alex: I haven't heard it many times
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Alex: Is it good
6/22/22, 2:18 AM - Alex: What happened
6/22/22, 2:19 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs slow but vibey
6/22/22, 2:19 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs kinda about sex lmao
6/22/22, 2:19 AM - Alex: "kinda"
6/22/22, 2:19 AM - Alex: I just skimmed lyrics
6/22/22, 2:20 AM - Alex: Plus she's wispering
6/22/22, 2:20 AM - Misheel: yeah
6/22/22, 2:20 AM - Alex: Plus there are saxophones
6/22/22, 2:20 AM - Alex: Not even being subtle
6/22/22, 2:20 AM - Misheel: i was like ‚Äúwhat do saxophones have to do w anything‚Äù then i was like oh
6/22/22, 2:21 AM - Alex: Wait what oh
6/22/22, 2:21 AM - Alex: It's not a sax -> sex joke
6/22/22, 2:21 AM - Alex: It's just saxaphons are always the üòè instrument
6/22/22, 2:21 AM - Alex: Careless Whisper is the prime example
6/22/22, 2:21 AM - Misheel: please never use the smirk emoji to imply sex üò≠
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Misheel: oh yeah
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: It's not just sex
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: It's whole vibe is
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: Just
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: Yk
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: üòè
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Misheel: dududududududu dudududu dududu du
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: Exactly
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: See you get it
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: ü§ç
6/22/22, 2:22 AM - Alex: Couldn't have put it better myself
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Misheel: wow
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Alex: WoW!! ü§©
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Misheel: you wanted to make that joke so badly you had to set up the white heart yourself?
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Alex: Well you're not gonna set me up with it out of nowhere
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Alex: And it's not a joke without that setup
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Misheel: you could have just said sth to make me send the white heart
6/22/22, 2:23 AM - Misheel: even tho it‚Äôs a gamble between ü•∞ü§ç
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Alex: No but its fine and genuine when its over text
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Alex: Which would make this rude
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Alex: If I so it myself then it's fine
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Alex: I wasn't even going to make the joke, it was just the dudududududu was funny so I was gonna say couldn't have put it better myself
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Alex: Then it remembered _the white heart incident_
6/22/22, 2:24 AM - Misheel: lmao
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Misheel: that makes sense
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Misheel: but it seems like you‚Äôre trying too hard which takes away funny points üò≠
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Alex: I'm known for my sense making
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Alex: Idk why that sent twice
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Misheel: think i‚Äôm more well known for that
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Alex: Because I just make so much sense ü§∑
6/22/22, 2:25 AM - Misheel: it did not
6/22/22, 2:26 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 2:26 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 2:26 AM - Alex: ü§∑
6/22/22, 2:26 AM - Alex: Disagreed
6/22/22, 2:27 AM - Alex: The fast white heart into the reply adds comedic value
6/22/22, 2:28 AM - Misheel: agree to d
6/22/22, 2:28 AM - Misheel: like gina said
6/22/22, 2:28 AM - Alex: I recall
6/22/22, 2:28 AM - Alex: Who's your fav Brooklyn 99 character
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: that is such a difficult question
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: but
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: i have 4 answers
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Alex: Uh
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Alex: Do you know what favourite means
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: i do
6/22/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: so i will list my top 4
6/22/22, 2:30 AM - Misheel: amy = holt = jake ~ rosa
6/22/22, 2:30 AM - Alex: My mum just asked my dad how? And he responded hen hao (ÂæàÂ•Ω) which means very good!
6/22/22, 2:30 AM - Alex: Why ~
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Alex: You had to have been there
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Misheel: rosa is practically as good
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Misheel: as the rest
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Misheel: but
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Misheel: there is something removed about her
6/22/22, 2:31 AM - Misheel: i was in london sadly
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: Oh really? What're you doing there?!
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: Actually
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: Talking about b99
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: No time for this bit
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: I think Jake is really funny but his humour is too close to mine
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Alex: I think Gina and Boyle are really funny
6/22/22, 2:32 AM - Misheel: Boyle is the funniest
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Alex: Is funniest not the same as favourite
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: my favourite lines are the ‚Äúcome up w a scary name? hitler‚Äù
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Alex: I was thinking funniest
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Alex: LMAOO
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Alex: when is that
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: and then theres something else
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: 2x22 the chopper
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: when theyre in the chopper
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: talking code names
6/22/22, 2:33 AM - Misheel: 2x21?
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Misheel: pre last episode
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Alex: Does that mean season 2 episode 22?
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Misheel: yes
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Misheel: my initial guess was correct
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Misheel: then 2x23 is johnny and dora
6/22/22, 2:34 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Misheel: impressive
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Alex: Impressive
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Misheel: theres also a really funny line
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Misheel: but it‚Äôs in season 5
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Misheel: i cant spoil
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Alex: It's probably recency bias
6/22/22, 2:35 AM - Alex: But Boyle oil killed me
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: boyle oil wasnt that funny
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Alex: ü§∑
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: your humour is scarily close to jake‚Äôs
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: genuinely
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: half the things you say
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Alex: Thanks ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: the main difference is
6/22/22, 2:36 AM - Misheel: you‚Äôre not a hater like jake is
6/22/22, 2:37 AM - Misheel: in that regard you‚Äôre terry
6/22/22, 2:37 AM - Alex: Jake is a hater?
6/22/22, 2:37 AM - Misheel: yeah if he talks about ppl he dislikes he gets v over the top w his dislike
6/22/22, 2:38 AM - Misheel: where he‚Äôs unreasonable
6/22/22, 2:38 AM - Alex: Yeah okay fair
6/22/22, 2:38 AM - Alex: I can imagine the head movements
6/22/22, 2:38 AM - Misheel: lmao
6/22/22, 2:39 AM - Misheel: i am clearly a combination of holt and amy with a sprinkle of rosa
6/22/22, 2:39 AM - Misheel: rosa only for my deadpan stares and leather jacket
6/22/22, 2:39 AM - Alex: Only Rosa when chemical weapons/mcflurry cups
6/22/22, 2:39 AM - Misheel: ü•∞
6/22/22, 2:40 AM - Alex: Couldn't have put it better myself

6/22/22, 2:40 AM - Alex: ü§∑
6/22/22, 2:40 AM - Misheel: Can imagine Jake doing that
6/22/22, 2:40 AM - Misheel: and bisexuality
6/22/22, 2:41 AM - Misheel: i remember spoiling this for you already so idm bringing this up
6/22/22, 2:41 AM - Misheel: but i also went into the show knowing that she was bi
6/22/22, 2:41 AM - Misheel: and the actress is bi
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Alex: Oh does she not stay married to that guy
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Alex: Spoiling that üôÑ
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Alex: Jk
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Misheel: She could stay married to that guy and be bi
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Alex: Wouldn't make for very interesting plot
6/22/22, 2:42 AM - Misheel: and just come out
6/22/22, 2:43 AM - Alex: But yeah true
6/22/22, 2:43 AM - Alex: I'm halfway through that episode
6/22/22, 2:43 AM - Alex: It's very eventful

6/22/22, 2:48 AM - Misheel: thats the only time it happens

6/23/22, 2:48 PM - Alex: He ignored my apology email üò≠üò≠üò≠

6/23/22, 9:40 PM - Alex: But it was good
6/23/22, 9:40 PM - Alex: Didn't get to apologize for being horrible with scheduling since she barely let me get a word in
6/23/22, 9:41 PM - Alex: I need to learn katagana and hiragana by term start
6/23/22, 9:44 PM - Misheel: Oh okay

6/23/22, 11:05 PM - Misheel: no
6/23/22, 11:05 PM - Alex: Well you are now
6/23/22, 11:05 PM - Alex: B99 spoilers for me at least
6/23/22, 11:05 PM - Misheel: ohh right yea
6/23/22, 11:06 PM - Misheel: i can just find it by searching jake and amy *song name*
6/23/22, 11:06 PM - Alex: ah alright
6/23/22, 11:06 PM - Misheel: but yes the combination of jean and gaurav talking about exams is deadly
6/23/22, 11:06 PM - Alex: jean makes you stressed becuase she remindes you of material Gaurav because he did well
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Misheel: gaurav is overly stressed but about so much more minor things
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Misheel: like i would like to be stressed about the things that gaurav is stressed about
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Misheel: jean stresses me out bc of the material
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Alex: I was under the impression you did fine for these exmas
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Alex: no?
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Misheel: no
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - Alex: at least not horribly
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: a few were "dissapointing"
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: and metods was bad
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: just compared to analysis 3
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: lmao
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: but everyone did bad on methods
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: im wondering whether i‚Äôll pass methods 4
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: and whether i‚Äôll pass fluids
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: I thought fluids went well
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: and whether i‚Äôll even get 60 on analysis 4
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: it did not
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: relative to how you thought it went
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Alex: it could have went*
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: ok maybe
6/23/22, 11:08 PM - Misheel: but now im thinking i made a shitton of mistakes
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: ahhh
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: ok ill stop
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: and saulet and gaurav talked about prestigious masters programmes
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Alex: you _probably_ didn't
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: i am there like üò≠üò≠
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Alex: It litteraly doesn't matter
6/23/22, 11:09 PM - Alex: if you wanna stay in academia, which you tottally can, then where you go doesn't matter because its all about your big brain girlboss research
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: and if you don't, plenty of carreers will take someone who speaks 4 languages and came from Mongolia to a prestigous undergrad school abroud ( I can't spell üò≠), then did a masters in another foreign country
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: either way
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: it'll be all fine for you
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: tell me I'm wrong
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Misheel: thank you
6/23/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: ong you can't
6/23/22, 11:12 PM - Misheel: i just gen feel a bit directionless atm ‚úåüèªüòô‚úåüèª but it‚Äôll pass hopefully
6/23/22, 11:12 PM - Misheel: and i will stop complaining
6/23/22, 11:13 PM - Alex: its fine
6/23/22, 11:13 PM - Misheel: but generally all of this talk stresses me out to the max
6/23/22, 11:13 PM - Alex: nothing wrong with being a scalar for a bit
6/23/22, 11:13 PM - Alex: and once you get vectored up, I'm sure you'll have a great magnitude üòÅ
6/23/22, 11:14 PM - Misheel: cute jokes
6/23/22, 11:14 PM - Alex: thanks
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Misheel: lmaooo
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Misheel: cheddar
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Alex: indeed
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Misheel: keep watching
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Alex: "time to make daddy proud"
6/23/22, 11:16 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠ holt
6/23/22, 11:18 PM - Misheel: https://londonist.com/london/transport/how-deep-is-your-commute-these-diagrams-show-the-depth-of-each-station?fbclid=IwAR0KWSMYHmDIpe0OwnY_dEFn3WAwjHG5vf7tEpead8E85gslIkxxEB32-E0&fs=e&s=cl#l4rl5qd2b2ywqqtwuic
6/23/22, 11:18 PM - Misheel: this just popped up on facebook
6/23/22, 11:18 PM - Misheel: so idk how updated or legit this is
6/23/22, 11:18 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 11:18 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 11:19 PM - Alex: but the joke deoesn't really get old
6/23/22, 11:19 PM - Misheel: it doesnt
6/23/22, 11:19 PM - Alex: I'd belive it
6/23/22, 11:20 PM - Alex: Hampstead is the deepest and the only one I've seen with a lift instead of an escelator
6/23/22, 11:20 PM - Alex: and the depth is really intrestign because the lower ones are harder to build, are louder and take people, albeit marginally, longer to get to, but are much faster
6/23/22, 11:21 PM - Alex: the victoria and norther line operate at around 50km/h if I remember correctly while the circle and district are around 20-30
6/23/22, 11:21 PM - Misheel: right
6/23/22, 11:21 PM - Alex: big differences
6/23/22, 11:21 PM - Misheel: oh wow

6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Misheel: and do whatever
6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Alex: thats once you land
6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Alex: they don't really check passports on the way out
6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Alex: right?
6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Misheel: they do
6/23/22, 11:28 PM - Misheel: but it depends

6/25/22, 4:04 PM - Misheel: what is going on this video
6/25/22, 4:04 PM - Alex: Wow just no empathy for my lense
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: Sticking my head out the window
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: i can believe that
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: While driving
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: So I have this eyedrop I put in before I use the plunger to get it out
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: But idk I guess I had to wait a bit long or use a bit more
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: So it didn't loosen it enough
6/25/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: So I just had the plunger stuck to the contact on my eye
6/25/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: And the plunger is (relatively) heavy
6/25/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: So it pulls the lense of my iris area into like the skin under the eye
6/25/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: Then it falls off
6/25/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: So the lense is under my eye skin
6/25/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: And I need to use more eye drops
6/25/22, 4:07 PM - Alex: Then pull back eye skin and plunge the lense from there

6/25/22, 5:16 PM - Alex: How long ago was this ex
6/25/22, 5:16 PM - Misheel: 12th grade aka 2019

6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Alex: Huh ok that's fast
6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Misheel: they were dating till early 2020
6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Misheel: And then he went to the military
6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Alex: Meet someone -> date (for a little bit I hope) -> 9 months -> kid
6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Alex: He really was speedrunning
6/25/22, 5:17 PM - Alex: Did they break up BC of him
6/25/22, 5:18 PM - Misheel: She said this is the only ex that she doesn‚Äôt think is awful
6/25/22, 5:18 PM - Misheel: It was mainly cause they were not compatible
6/25/22, 5:18 PM - Alex: Oh alright

6/25/22, 11:32 PM - Alex: Do you think the bear should just be my voice or should I put others, it's up to 20 seconds
6/25/22, 11:41 PM - Misheel: probably just your voice

6/26/22, 12:49 AM - Misheel: we can both be crying
6/26/22, 12:49 AM - Alex: True
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: also
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: i really dont understand the scale of the US
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: I cannot find anything
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: whenever you‚Äôre away from your folsom house
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Alex: Yeah too big
6/26/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: i have no idea what zoom i should be using
6/26/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: 228 Waverly st is my house
6/26/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: Driving home rn
6/26/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: Oh ok
6/26/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: that is far alexander
6/26/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: Indeed
6/26/22, 12:54 AM - Alex: 2 hours drive
6/26/22, 12:54 AM - Misheel: hm
6/26/22, 12:54 AM - Misheel: maybe not that far then?? 2 hrs is how long it takes to get to tuv province
6/26/22, 12:54 AM - Misheel: I have no idea how to compare the size of the us to anything really
6/26/22, 12:55 AM - Alex: I mean Mongolia is pretty big too
6/26/22, 12:55 AM - Misheel: it is
6/26/22, 12:55 AM - Misheel: but like
6/26/22, 12:55 AM - Misheel: that‚Äôs different
6/26/22, 12:55 AM - Alex: How so
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: inside the city
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: aka ulaanbaatar
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Alex: Like in terms of distance
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: everythings super close
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: but also not close without a car
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: but also close
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: but then when you leave ulaanbaatar
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: everything takes ages
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Alex: ???
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Misheel: that 2 hours doesnt feel that long
6/26/22, 12:56 AM - Alex: ???
6/26/22, 12:57 AM - Misheel: ie tuv aimag is technically the surrounding province so it‚Äôs not ‚Äú2 hrs‚Äù away from ulaanbaatar bc you can take a step at the border or whatever
6/26/22, 12:57 AM - Misheel: but
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: tuv aimag feels close
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Alex: What is tuv aimag
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: even though it isnt
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: tuv province
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: wrong screenshot
6/26/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 12:59 AM - Alex: The only other thing on the map
6/26/22, 12:59 AM - Alex: Is 2 hours away
6/26/22, 12:59 AM - Misheel: thats a zoomed in version
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: like going to tuv aimag is like less than a daytrip
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: so it feels close yk?
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: but its far
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: but its close bc its closer than anything else
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: does that make sense
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: Yeah living in London with no car probably messes with distance perception
6/26/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: yeah
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: i checked and my walk from home to the city centre is 54 mins according to google maps
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: I guess ¬ø
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: but it feels super close
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: like walking to ucl feels further than walking to the city centre
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: But the mountain road
6/26/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: üòÆ
6/26/22, 1:02 AM - Misheel: you dont have to take the mountain road

6/26/22, 1:43 PM - Alex: Idk doesn't seem that bad a thing to tell Saulet but I guess maybe you should've
6/26/22, 1:43 PM - Misheel: we kinda brushed over it after but you know how he has things in the back of his mind
6/26/22, 1:43 PM - Alex: Mhmm
6/26/22, 1:44 PM - Misheel: idk
6/26/22, 1:44 PM - Alex: Then again it doesn't feel like he's that much closer to us than to Saulet so idk why it's a big deal
6/26/22, 1:45 PM - Alex: Especially enough to warrant this
6/26/22, 1:45 PM - Alex: When did this happen
6/26/22, 1:45 PM - Misheel: at spitalfields
6/26/22, 1:45 PM - Misheel: ie an hour before we saw the prof at the bus station
6/26/22, 1:46 PM - Misheel: probably because he doesnt want saulets opinion of matias to fall lower than it already is
6/26/22, 1:46 PM - Alex: Okay that's a fair point
6/26/22, 1:46 PM - Alex: Oh also
6/26/22, 1:46 PM - Alex: What brought on the boyemployee Revolution

6/26/22, 1:52 PM - Alex: Like not understood how to inflate it, I feel like we ran into this problem already
6/26/22, 1:53 PM - Misheel: did we
6/26/22, 1:53 PM - Alex: I think you and Gaurav were struggling together
6/26/22, 1:53 PM - Misheel: we were
6/26/22, 1:53 PM - Misheel: but we closed the big hole
6/26/22, 1:53 PM - Misheel: then never filled through the small holep
6/26/22, 1:54 PM - Misheel: and left the small hole open
6/26/22, 1:54 PM - Misheel: ie thats why it was uncomfy when i woke up
6/26/22, 1:54 PM - Misheel: the air was slowly being lwt out
6/26/22, 1:54 PM - Alex: Did we? I'm pretty sure it was empty when you woke up because the mattress sucks
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Alex: Now that Nutford is over I don't need to worry about my mattress reputation
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Misheel: no
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Misheel: it was def open
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Alex: I feel like maybe I shouldn't say things like "my mattress reputation"
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Alex: Ok
6/26/22, 1:55 PM - Misheel: taylor swift
6/26/22, 1:56 PM - Alex: Yes Taylor swift Indeed

6/27/22, 12:00 AM - Misheel: probably
6/27/22, 12:00 AM - Misheel: i mean
6/27/22, 12:00 AM - Misheel: theres a lot of papers out there right
6/27/22, 12:01 AM - Alex: Right but isn't your project following a set of papers
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: kind of
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: but the set can change
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: she was like
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: im super flexible
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: if you find this more interesting than that then we can do this bla bla
6/27/22, 12:02 AM - Misheel: sorry
6/27/22, 12:04 AM - Alex: Oh cool so infinite papers
6/27/22, 12:04 AM - Alex: Find your own papers why not
6/27/22, 12:04 AM - Alex: Read a textbook while you're at it
6/27/22, 12:04 AM - Alex: ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑
6/27/22, 12:04 AM - Misheel: :)
6/27/22, 12:24 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 12:25 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 12:26 AM - Misheel: slay
6/27/22, 12:28 AM - Misheel: nobody plays the piano at nutford anymore :(
6/27/22, 12:28 AM - Alex: :(((
6/27/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: realised im dumb
6/27/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: lmao
6/27/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: i thought the middle third was supposed to be removed
6/27/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: turns out its the middle half
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: Oh my god
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: The middle half ü§¶ü§¶
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: I get the middle half and third confused all the time
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: Classic misstep
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Misheel: alex üò≠
6/27/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: Mosh üò≠
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Misheel: yoy
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Misheel: i was trying to prove sth completely different
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Alex: Ok you wanna explain what you meant
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Misheel: all along
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Misheel: ok
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Alex: Like for the audience
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Alex: I already know
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Misheel: so basically
6/27/22, 12:46 AM - Alex: Ofc
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: i am supposed to prove that if you take an infinite number of iterates of a function, then the set of points that dont eventually become fixed form a cantor set
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: and a classic cantor set is one
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: where you keep removing the middle interval
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: open middle i should say
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Alex: Okay
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: so if you have an interval [0,1] after the first one
6/27/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: you get
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Misheel: [0, 1/3] U [2/3, 1]
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Misheel: because you removed (1/3, 2/3)
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: Ohhh I see
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: How do you decide on 1/3 being the interval
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Misheel: and then you remove the middle third of [0, 1/3] and [2/3]
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: The size that is
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: Mhmm
6/27/22, 12:48 AM - Misheel: thats the classic example
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Alex: Right ok
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Misheel: the most simple one
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Misheel: because its the easiest one where all the intervals are the same
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Alex: And are the inputs of the functions that don't get fixed intervals?
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Alex: That make cantor sets?
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Misheel: uhh only for the function that im looking at
6/27/22, 12:49 AM - Alex: Epic function
6/27/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: the cantor set itself is a silly quirky thing w various properties that im unaware of
6/27/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: so my function f is defined on [0,1] mapped to [0,1]
6/27/22, 12:50 AM - Alex: Okay
6/27/22, 12:50 AM - Misheel: and i need to show that all the points that are not eventually fixed
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: so eventually f^(k+1)=f^(k)(x)
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: form a set thats similar to the cantor set
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Alex: Similar to the cantor set?
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: ie if you keep removing infinite middle bits
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: and i assumed that that meant
6/27/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: keep removing infinite thirds
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: but i had a closer look at the function
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: turns out you remove the middle half
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: How does that work tho?
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: so you end up with 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 length intervals
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: Huh
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: That's strange
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: or you could imagine it as
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: Then the side domains aren't the same
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: As the inner one
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4
6/27/22, 12:52 AM - Alex: Right
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: Ohhhh
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: and removing the middle 2
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: That makes sense
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: yeah
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: i did not realise i had to do that
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: cause in the previous part i showed that in order for a point not to be eventually periodic
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: And now that you did
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: Easy moneyM
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Alex: Money?*
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: i hope so
6/27/22, 12:53 AM - Misheel: it should go easier
6/27/22, 12:55 AM - Alex: Good luck ü•∞‚ÄºÔ∏è
6/27/22, 12:55 AM - Misheel: thank you ü§çü§çü•∞ü•∞
6/27/22, 12:59 AM - Misheel: yep
6/27/22, 12:59 AM - Misheel: done

6/27/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: i need to do laundry before showering
6/27/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: so laundry early
6/27/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: All before breakfast
6/27/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: üò≠
6/27/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: yes
6/27/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: That's too much
6/27/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: You can do laundry, the shower while it's running
6/27/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: Then put it in dryer then breakfast while drying
6/27/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: Light work

6/27/22, 1:04 AM - Misheel: i got the gist
6/27/22, 1:04 AM - Misheel: but i need to lay it out nicely
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Alex: Your big brain needs sleep energy to talk to supervisor
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Alex: Do you always latex it
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Alex: Is paper not good enough
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Misheel: paper is not good enough for my supervisor
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Alex: üò•
6/27/22, 1:05 AM - Misheel: as it should be üòå
6/27/22, 1:06 AM - Misheel: paper rings ü§çü§çü§ç

6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Misheel: Yooy
6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Misheel: i am v tired
6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Alex: Maybe sleeping
6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Alex: That's what people do when they're tried
6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Alex: Tired
6/27/22, 1:07 AM - Misheel: mhm
6/27/22, 1:08 AM - Alex: ‚û∞üòÅ
6/27/22, 1:08 AM - Alex: That's a rope
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Misheel: ??
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Misheel: Why a rope?
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Misheel: are you saying
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Alex: Tried instead of tired
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Misheel: youre killing urself?
6/27/22, 1:10 AM - Alex: Yes
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: Wait
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: When people are being tried
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: That's also kinda tired
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: Nvm
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Alex: Rope revoked
6/27/22, 1:11 AM - Misheel: lmao
6/27/22, 1:13 AM - Misheel: right
6/27/22, 1:17 AM - Alex: Did you have to think for two minutes to conclude that "right" is the correct thing to say here
6/27/22, 1:17 AM - Alex: After a lmao
6/27/22, 1:19 AM - Misheel: i was washing my face
6/27/22, 1:19 AM - Misheel: and i often type very absent mindedly
6/27/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: Oh wow not even trying in conversation anymoreüôÑüôÑ
6/27/22, 1:20 AM - Misheel: too tired
6/27/22, 1:20 AM - Alex: Ok fair enough
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Misheel: but also i generally type absent mindedly if im doing sth
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Misheel: or im with someone
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Alex: If I text you and it's before 9am CA time all my texts are at like 35% brain capacity
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Alex: But I'll do that
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Misheel: i am not a multitasker
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Alex: Like the whole conversation this morning
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Alex: Being able to text while talking to someone is multitasking
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Misheel: a lot of your texts are before 9am CA time
6/27/22, 1:21 AM - Alex: But did you know you can't actually multitask
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Alex: Your brain can just switch between tasks quickly
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Misheel: right
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Misheel: literally most of our convo today was before 9am ca time
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Alex: Yeah a lot of my texts are at 35%
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Alex: Okay
6/27/22, 1:22 AM - Misheel: 9am ca time is 5pm uk time
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Alex: It starts at 35%
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Alex: Then it increases gradually
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Misheel: yeah that makes more sense
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Misheel: you will also be able to tell when i am replying while half asleep
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Misheel: like the ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Misheel: to your picture
6/27/22, 1:23 AM - Alex: Very good at being mostly asleep for texting
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: Oh yeah I kinda figured
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: my message went to seen as soon as i sent it
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: but you did not reply
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: and were online the whole time
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: lmao
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: so i was like
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: probably fell asleep or sth
6/27/22, 1:24 AM - Alex: Yeah asleep with the phone in my hand üôÉ
6/27/22, 1:25 AM - Misheel: ok realised this sounds a bit insane üòá i promise im not insane
6/27/22, 1:25 AM - Misheel: how are you still not used to the time diff though üò≠
6/27/22, 1:25 AM - Misheel: going backwards is usually ok
6/27/22, 1:25 AM - Misheel: ie going west
6/27/22, 1:26 AM - Alex: ???? This isn't insane
6/27/22, 1:26 AM - Alex: That's a logical conclusion
6/27/22, 1:26 AM - Alex: I'm mostly accustomed
6/27/22, 1:26 AM - Alex: I'd wake up to check my phone when I was sleeping
6/27/22, 1:26 AM - Misheel: mhm
6/27/22, 1:27 AM - Misheel: 5.32am
6/27/22, 1:27 AM - Misheel: yooy
6/27/22, 1:27 AM - Alex: Okay maybe not totally
6/27/22, 1:28 AM - Misheel: mhm
6/27/22, 1:28 AM - Alex: There's just a piano in my house
6/27/22, 1:28 AM - Alex: This is sick
6/27/22, 1:28 AM - Misheel: there is
6/27/22, 1:29 AM - Misheel: that is sick indeed
6/27/22, 1:29 AM - Misheel: learn t swizzle ü•∫ ?
6/27/22, 1:29 AM - Alex: Not sure there's many good t swizzle songs for piano
6/27/22, 1:29 AM - Alex: But I'll look
6/27/22, 1:29 AM - Misheel: wildest dreams?
6/27/22, 1:30 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 1:30 AM - Misheel: oh no
6/27/22, 1:31 AM - Misheel: library trip??
6/27/22, 1:31 AM - Misheel: or yk
6/27/22, 1:31 AM - Misheel: ink trip
6/27/22, 1:31 AM - Misheel: printer trip
6/27/22, 1:31 AM - Misheel: idk
6/27/22, 1:33 AM - Alex: Ink is expensive üò≠üò≠üò≠
6/27/22, 1:33 AM - Alex: I think library trip proby
6/27/22, 1:33 AM - Misheel: i dont understand
6/27/22, 1:33 AM - Misheel: i hate the fact that ink is expensive
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Alex: Yeah
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Alex: They sell printers at a loss I think
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Alex: Allegedly
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Misheel: yeah ive heard this
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Alex: Then sell ink that takes like 12 c to produce for 20¬£
6/27/22, 1:35 AM - Misheel: yeah
6/27/22, 1:37 AM - Misheel: yooy
6/27/22, 1:37 AM - Misheel: ok
6/27/22, 1:37 AM - Misheel: actual sleep time
6/27/22, 1:37 AM - Alex: Actual sleep time üòÅ
6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Misheel: mhm
6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Misheel: good night ü§ç

6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Misheel: or sth
6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Misheel: its a huge win
6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Alex: Massive dub ü§†
6/27/22, 1:40 AM - Misheel: i dont understand

6/27/22, 6:46 AM - Alex: The audacity of this child
6/27/22, 6:47 AM - Alex: Johnny is like why did you get a piano when you already have a keyboard, because with the keyboard you can just play by yourself but with the piano everyone has to hear you play
6/27/22, 6:47 AM - Alex: First of all
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: The keyboard is like 40 dollars and has no key sensitivity, no pedals, and sounds bad
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: Second of all
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: This child has picked the 3 loudest instruments he could find
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: Drums, trumpet, and symbols
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: And either practices them in his room, right next to mine
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: Or outside
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: Also next to my room
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: The piano is as far from his room as possible
6/27/22, 6:48 AM - Alex: I can't believe this
6/27/22, 8:52 AM - Misheel: smh
6/27/22, 8:52 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠

6/29/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs not an actual word
6/29/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs like saying dunno instead of dont know

6/29/22, 8:32 PM - Misheel: because thats how the actual word works

7/2/22, 12:41 AM - Alex: My dogs are actually impressively stupid
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Alex: They don't really like their dry food but can't eat any human food without throwing it back up
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Alex: Which never stops them from begging
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Alex: But anyway they get disappointed when there is dry food
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Misheel: ü•∞
7/2/22, 12:42 AM - Alex: But they've managed to associate the sound of the bag crinkling with food about to appear in their bowls
7/2/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: But have *not*  associated it with dry food
7/2/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: So every time we give them dry food
7/2/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: They get excited and sniff around around and skuttle along the floor
7/2/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: Then once dry food is poured they're always surprised and disappointed
7/2/22, 12:44 AM - Alex: And they'll look over their shoulder at us being like "really?"
7/2/22, 12:45 AM - Misheel: What now???
7/2/22, 12:45 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠

7/2/22, 12:47 AM - Misheel: explain
7/2/22, 12:47 AM - Alex: Because there are two bowls and peach chooses one then Yoshi either waits for her to move away or chooses the other one
7/2/22, 12:47 AM - Alex: Lemme see if I can get it on video
7/2/22, 12:47 AM - Alex: Oh nvm Yoshi lost interest
7/2/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: But in the beginning of yosh would try to eat from the bowl at the same time peach would attack
7/2/22, 12:48 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/2/22, 12:48 AM - Alex: Make vicious sounds and such

7/3/22, 10:55 PM - Misheel: and powers of functions
7/3/22, 10:55 PM - Misheel: that I automatically assumed that when she wrote f^5 she meant f to the power of 5 rather than f applied 5 times
7/3/22, 10:55 PM - Misheel: I am so stupid
7/3/22, 10:55 PM - Misheel: This is unbelievable

7/5/22, 3:33 PM - Misheel: yeah
7/5/22, 3:33 PM - Alex: If you don't seriously enjoy all of it it would definitely be hell
7/5/22, 3:35 PM - Alex: Have you been papering it up or just existing
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Misheel: I have been existing
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Misheel: I finished the movie
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Misheel: Guess what happened
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Alex: Sometimes we take an existing, decidedly better than not existing

7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Alex: ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Alex: Is my guess
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Misheel: they had sex as soon as they got in the hotel room
7/5/22, 3:36 PM - Alex: Shocker
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Misheel: then she defends him in front of his dad who thinks he‚Äôs a disappointment and his mum tells her he‚Äôs been obsessed w her for a while
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Misheel: theyre still competing for the job
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Alex: Aw
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Misheel: she overhears his convo w his boss and their plans to destroy her and she believes that he did all this to lead her on to get the job
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Misheel: and goes rampage mad
7/5/22, 3:37 PM - Alex: Mhmm saw that in the trailer
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: then they compete
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: and then turns out
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Alex: And he sabotages himself
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: that he resigned
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Alex: !!!!

7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: and she got it
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Alex: But then she doesn't want him to leave ü•∞
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: and the reason he never told her is because her boss told him not to say anything
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Alex: Mhmm
7/5/22, 3:38 PM - Misheel: because he makes her competitive
7/5/22, 3:39 PM - Misheel: so she‚Äôd beat everyone
7/5/22, 3:39 PM - Alex: Ohhhh
7/5/22, 3:39 PM - Alex: Cool
7/5/22, 3:39 PM - Misheel: and then it flashes forward to them just being happy at his new job and her new job
7/5/22, 3:39 PM - Alex: Are they still together?

7/6/22, 8:22 PM - Alex: idk I sometimes see offers to teach like small children and I'm always a bit uncomfy because when its calc or something its more just knowing and explainign the concepts but when its something like arithmatic its 100% just teaching ability not maths knoelage
7/6/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: Hm yeah that‚Äôs true
7/6/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: basic algebra
7/6/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs like
7/6/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: 1st one has 20 more apples than the 2nd one. 3rd one has the same number of apples as 1st and 2nd combined. If they have 400 apples in total how many apples does each have
7/6/22, 8:24 PM - Alex: oh wow
7/6/22, 8:24 PM - Alex: thats actually kinda hard
7/6/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: She is in 4th grade
7/6/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: I think that‚Äôs ok
7/6/22, 8:25 PM - Misheel: But she just didn‚Äôt understand why I was using x, so I switched to ‚Äúapples of the 2nd one‚Äù which was so long and I was trying my hardest to explain that this is just writing things down that have to be true
7/6/22, 8:25 PM - Alex: you just have a big variable called "apples of the 2nd one"
7/6/22, 8:25 PM - Misheel: Yeah
7/6/22, 8:26 PM - Misheel: I think she got it in the end
7/6/22, 8:26 PM - Alex: well done
7/6/22, 8:26 PM - Misheel: But it took an hour and her hw was 5 exercises
7/6/22, 8:26 PM - Misheel: and we only got through the first one

7/6/22, 8:37 PM - Misheel: 1st year tutorials were helpful imo

7/6/22, 8:44 PM - Misheel: this is a joke
7/6/22, 8:44 PM - Alex: is the joke that you've said more than one smart thing or you haven't said anything smart ever
7/6/22, 8:44 PM - Alex: with the staet your self-esteem is in recently would not be surprised by the latter
7/6/22, 8:44 PM - Misheel: it wasnt smart
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: it was basically a thing where she started going through the exercise using line integrals
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: and i said
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: can we just use the fundamental theorem
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: and she was like oh yeah
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Alex: oh right, isn't that the thing eric did
7/6/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: yeah

7/6/22, 8:46 PM - Misheel: yes
7/6/22, 8:46 PM - Alex: yeah idk I liked my analysis tutor

7/6/22, 8:51 PM - Misheel: if it‚Äôs a group conversation
7/6/22, 8:51 PM - Misheel: he will not look at me
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Misheel: if it‚Äôs individual he‚Äôll talk to me
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Misheel: by group convo i mean me + one person + ashman
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Alex: Lmao
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Alex: How many times did that happen
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Misheel: esp if that person is beatrice
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Misheel: fairly often
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Alex: Oh got it lol
7/6/22, 8:52 PM - Misheel: i dont think he‚Äôs trying to hit on her
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Misheel: but it‚Äôs still genuinely annoying
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Misheel: he helped me
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Misheel: so i cant say too many bad things about him
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Alex: Helped with what?
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Misheel: and then he also tried to promote his tutoring services to me üíÄ
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Misheel: he was like i can help w linear alg
7/6/22, 8:53 PM - Alex: Also is he doesn't seem like a maths computery guy to me
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Misheel: sending emails
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Misheel: to potential supervisors
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Alex: Oh lmao
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Alex: That's nice tho!!
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Misheel: for money
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Misheel: and i was like why would i pay for tutoring
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Misheel: and i didnt even indicate that i was struggling w anything
7/6/22, 8:54 PM - Alex: Yeah that's a little weird
7/6/22, 8:55 PM - Misheel: yeah he was basically like ‚Äújust send them your grades tell them why you picked them and send it off - don‚Äôt worry about sounding stupid‚Äù
7/6/22, 8:55 PM - Misheel: idk what i was even stressing about
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Alex: Idk whenever I offer to help people with maths I don't ask them to go thought the website, just because it's weird and gross
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Alex: True
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Misheel: because it was kind of just common sense stuff but i genuinely didnt know what to put in the email
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Misheel: like i know why i picked them
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Alex: He's probably right though ü§†
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Misheel: but also it sounded dumb
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Misheel: and also probably only if theyre like ‚Äúi am struggling w maths‚Äù
7/6/22, 8:56 PM - Misheel: i am fine
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Misheel: at that time at least
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Misheel: not fine anymore
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Misheel: but tutoring will not help üíÄ
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Misheel: i get the concepts and everything
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Alex: Yeah
7/6/22, 8:57 PM - Alex: üíÄüíÄüíÄ

7/6/22, 9:06 PM - Alex: üá©üá™
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Alex: Yeah transport was very very densely built in berlin
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Misheel: one of which started when i was like 8 or sth and i was not in germany
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Alex: It's nice
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Misheel: and it has no driver
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Alex: Magic
7/6/22, 9:07 PM - Misheel: so you can be in the front or back wagon
7/6/22, 9:08 PM - Misheel: and see it just move
7/6/22, 9:08 PM - Misheel: like see the tracks in front
7/6/22, 9:08 PM - Misheel: or behind you

7/6/22, 9:12 PM - Misheel: lmaoo
7/6/22, 9:12 PM - Misheel: crack the egg softly split it in two and then do a little dancy dance w the egg yolk
7/6/22, 9:13 PM - Misheel: is my strategy
7/6/22, 9:13 PM - Alex: If I didn't know how to do this "a little dancy dance with the egg yolk" would be impressively useless advice
7/6/22, 9:14 PM - Alex: But yes
7/6/22, 9:14 PM - Alex: Little dancy dance
7/6/22, 9:14 PM - Misheel: mhm

7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Alex: your in person interview

7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Alex: bro what
7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Misheel: and the other one was interviewing
7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Misheel: me
7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Alex: you were that boring? rough
7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Misheel: she was like ‚Äúi nodded off‚Äù
7/6/22, 10:26 PM - Alex: hahah
7/6/22, 10:27 PM - Misheel: https://youtu.be/5VaoZ2oKYcs
7/6/22, 10:27 PM - Misheel: ^ he was interviewing me
7/6/22, 10:27 PM - Misheel: and the question was really easy
7/6/22, 10:27 PM - Alex: thats insane
7/6/22, 10:27 PM - Misheel: as in the question in the yt video
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: oh what
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: super basic optimization
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Misheel: yeah
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Misheel: so her falling asleep is justified
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: I could do that when I was 15 I think?
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: why are they asking you taht
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Misheel: idk
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: it seems weird bc they asked me quirky silly questions not like textbook maths
7/6/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: whatever
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: idk my questions were all over the place
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: one of them was
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: prove that there is no polynomial function that only produces primes
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: ???
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: like the output is only prime numbers?
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: when integers are put into it
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: oh
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: yeah
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: idk how to do that
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: it was v difficult
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: contradiction?
7/6/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: he kept talking and talking at me
7/6/22, 10:30 PM - Misheel: and eventually i got it
7/6/22, 10:30 PM - Misheel: and then i immediately forgot after i left the room
7/6/22, 10:30 PM - Alex: one of mine was if there is a town with 365 people can there be a day where nobody has a birthday and I very confidently said no, one person on each day
7/6/22, 10:30 PM - Alex: üò≠
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: then they asked me ‚Äúwhat is the maximum distance any two points can have if there are 5 points inside a square of length 1‚Äù
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: and then asked me to prove it
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: lmaooo
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Alex: to be fair he prefaced it with something that I think was meant to trick me but still üò≠
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: its fine
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Alex: sqrt(2)?
7/6/22, 10:31 PM - Alex: I think im misunderstanding the question
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: there are 5 points scattered inside a square w side 1
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: 1/sqrt(2)
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: and i did a thing with just putting the points in arbitrary places
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: giving an example
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: and they were like thats not a proof
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: and then they said
7/6/22, 10:32 PM - Alex: oh like if you position them optimally how do you maximize the distance between the closest 2?
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: between the furthest two
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Alex: well just put one in each corner?
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: nvm im stupid
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: closest 2
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: think of dividing the square
7/6/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: and then i was like oh
7/6/22, 10:34 PM - Alex: is it one on each corner and one in the middle?
7/6/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: yes
7/6/22, 10:34 PM - Alex: its lit
7/6/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: but when i did that
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: they said
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: thats not a proof
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Alex: im going to oxford ü•≥
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Alex: oh
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: so what i did
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: was
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Alex: üò¢
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: split the square into 4 smaller square
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: s
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: since we have 5 points
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: two points must lie within one square
7/6/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: then the distance between them is maximised if you put them on the diagonal
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Alex: ahhhh smart
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Misheel: and then the one at the other college absolutely destroyed me
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Misheel: they did not let me talk at all
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Misheel: they just kept yelling at me
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Alex: yelling at you üò¢
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Alex: my second one was kinda funny
7/6/22, 10:36 PM - Alex: there were two guys

7/6/22, 10:37 PM - Alex: and first guy went again
7/6/22, 10:37 PM - Alex: then 2nd guy didn't get a word in lmao
7/6/22, 10:37 PM - Misheel: lmaooo üò≠üò≠

7/7/22, 8:50 AM - Alex: oh no
7/7/22, 8:50 AM - Alex: they're ruining the dream dogs üò¢

7/7/22, 8:51 AM - Alex: miss girl
7/7/22, 8:51 AM - Alex: was the cute doggos dream Alex's idea
7/7/22, 9:21 AM - Alex: because if it was thats 4-0 for dream Alex slaying it out in dreams I think
7/7/22, 9:49 AM - Misheel: i dont know
7/7/22, 10:06 AM - Alex: üò¢
7/7/22, 10:11 AM - Misheel: im so stressed

7/7/22, 10:17 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/7/22, 10:21 AM - Alex: no but even if results aren't good, you'll be okay and results are probably better than your expecting
7/7/22, 10:22 AM - Misheel: i am terrified of not passing. and even if i pass everything i will still be disappointed by the low scores
7/7/22, 10:22 AM - Misheel: yooy
7/7/22, 10:23 AM - Misheel: also
7/7/22, 10:23 AM - Misheel: maybe should you sleep
7/7/22, 10:24 AM - Alex: nah im good
7/7/22, 10:24 AM - Alex: and you'll definitly pass thats not the main worry
7/7/22, 10:24 AM - Misheel: that is kinda the main worry
7/7/22, 10:26 AM - Alex: ok for the other things I'm largely speculating but just based on how you reacted when you were less stressed and the fact that 1) you studied for all your exams adn 2) you're just a smart person you definitly didn't fail
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Misheel: i also studied for complex analysis üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Misheel: like a shitton
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Misheel: yooy
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Misheel: ok
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Misheel: i‚Äôm sorry
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - Alex: its okay to be stressed
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Alex: but none of the exams went nearly as bad as complex analysis
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Misheel: methods 4 üò≠üò≠
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Alex: and you passed it anyway
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Misheel: and also what if complex analysis went down
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Alex: was better, if marginally
7/7/22, 10:28 AM - Alex: grades don't magically go down because people hate you ms girl
7/7/22, 10:30 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/7/22, 10:35 AM - Alex: I promise you'll be alright!!! everything will be fine smart people are fine therefore you'll be rather alright :D
7/7/22, 10:35 AM - Misheel: thank you üò≠
7/7/22, 10:35 AM - Misheel: real sweet
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Alex: even if your grades don't mega kill it, I feel like two summer research projects about maths is a pretty big deal
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Alex: 3 if you count the presentation
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Alex: should maybe not count the presentation tho haha
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Misheel: lmaoo we just got yelled at for the presentation for an hour straight
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Misheel: lmaoo
7/7/22, 10:39 AM - Alex: lmaoo
7/7/22, 10:40 AM - Misheel: hopefully ü§ûüèª
7/7/22, 10:41 AM - Alex: idk I feel like showing intrest in the subject and being willing and able to do these cool optional things is a bigger statement than just being good at workign the course
7/7/22, 10:41 AM - Alex: and also
7/7/22, 10:41 AM - Alex: you haven't gotten results yet
7/7/22, 10:41 AM - Misheel: I‚Äôm so stressed

7/7/22, 10:43 AM - Alex: I mean i'd say you know better than I do, but I think the stress might be getting to you a little, after you actually took the exams you seemed, for the most part, fine
7/7/22, 10:43 AM - Alex: so I think youll be fine
7/7/22, 10:44 AM - Misheel: mostly cause i was more happy they were ove r
7/7/22, 10:44 AM - Alex: I mean after each one

7/7/22, 11:08 AM - Misheel: methods 4
7/7/22, 11:08 AM - Misheel: and obvs complex analysis
7/7/22, 11:08 AM - Alex: eh

7/7/22, 6:23 PM - Misheel: i bullshitted so much on all the exams
7/7/22, 6:23 PM - Misheel: i think they adjusted methods
7/7/22, 6:24 PM - Alex: How do you assess how well you did that badly
7/7/22, 6:24 PM - Alex: Was 70-80 expected for the ones you know went well
7/7/22, 6:24 PM - Misheel: yeah i expected 70ish for number theory
7/7/22, 6:24 PM - Misheel: analysis was like high 60s low 70s
7/7/22, 6:25 PM - Misheel: algebra 3&4 was 80+ expected
7/7/22, 6:25 PM - Misheel: i expected 50 in fluids though

7/8/22, 1:51 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 1:51 AM - Misheel: this is what we were talking about!!
7/8/22, 1:52 AM - Alex: Yeah it is!!
7/8/22, 1:52 AM - Alex: Feel like this always happens
7/8/22, 1:52 AM - Alex: We talk about smthn then it appears
7/8/22, 1:52 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs either
a) all platforms are always listening
b) we just talk about a lot
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: Very possibly both
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: I think likely both
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Misheel: yeah
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: Feel like Reddit doesn't tho? At least about stuff like limits being interchangeable
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Alex: Idk maybe I'm just a Reddit sympathyser
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Misheel: i was going through r/math to be fair
7/8/22, 1:53 AM - Misheel: i was looking for hot goss on the fields medalists
7/8/22, 1:54 AM - Alex: Haha
7/8/22, 1:54 AM - Alex: Find any?
7/8/22, 1:54 AM - Alex: I watched a video on them, just cropped up
7/8/22, 1:54 AM - Alex: Pretty cool, they must have mega simplified the stuff tho, they only talked about the actual maths for a little
7/8/22, 1:55 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 1:55 AM - Misheel: yeah
7/8/22, 1:56 AM - Alex: Lmaoooo
7/8/22, 1:56 AM - Alex: He's a maths nerd, kinda on her ü§∑
7/8/22, 1:57 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 1:57 AM - Misheel: gonna be 24
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Sick, that's old enough to get it right?
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Or are we aiming for 28?
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Misheel: there‚Äôs no lower age limit iirc
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Misheel: lmaoo
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Alex: Misheel "Fielding medal" Ganzorig
7/8/22, 1:58 AM - Misheel: i was just saying old enough to attend it as a volunteerüò≠
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Alex: Oh right
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Alex: Same
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Alex: ü§†
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: i wanted to volunteer for this one actually
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: before the whole war
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: because they wanted russian speakers
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: and they said the more languages the better
7/8/22, 1:59 AM - Misheel: and i dont need a visa to enter russia
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Alex: That's so cool
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Alex: Speaking 4 languages comes in handy I guess üò≠
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Misheel: yes
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Misheel: you know in mongolian we have this saying
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs actually my favourite mongolian saying
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Misheel: heltei bol hultei
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Alex: Speak a bunch of languages for fun?
7/8/22, 2:00 AM - Misheel: which means
7/8/22, 2:01 AM - Misheel: if you have hel (language/tongue depending on context) then you have hul (feet/legs¬£
7/8/22, 2:01 AM - Misheel: ie languages are the thing you need to get by
7/8/22, 2:02 AM - Alex: And you have both üòÅ
7/8/22, 2:02 AM - Alex: (because you speak all the languages and have enormous calfs [presumably])
7/8/22, 2:02 AM - Misheel: lmaooo
7/8/22, 2:03 AM - Alex: That is cool tho
7/8/22, 2:03 AM - Misheel: Yeah

7/8/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 2:07 AM - Misheel: i actually dont know the proof for that one
7/8/22, 2:07 AM - Alex: Oh I do!
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: Ok the way I know isn't super proofy
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: But it's like, imagine writing a decimal number for each natural number 1-1
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: ohh
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: ok
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Misheel: got it
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: Then you can make another one by taking the first digit of the first number and adding 1 to it then the second of the second number
7/8/22, 2:08 AM - Alex: Yeah yeah
7/8/22, 2:09 AM - Misheel: that‚Äôs cool
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Alex: Still weird how the even naturals have the same size as the naturals ü•¥
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: Yep
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Alex: That emoji looks very different
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: Fun
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Misheel: exciting
7/8/22, 2:11 AM - Alex: My friends don't believe me üò≠
7/8/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: well a decent chunk of them are gonna be math bros
7/8/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: so they will believe u eventually
7/8/22, 2:12 AM - Misheel: or are math bros already
7/8/22, 2:12 AM - Alex: One is a computer science bro
7/8/22, 2:13 AM - Alex: One of them is a soon to be data science with a math inclination bro
7/8/22, 2:13 AM - Misheel: then he will never believe u
7/8/22, 2:13 AM - Alex: Like data science but more math based
7/8/22, 2:13 AM - Misheel: ok also

7/8/22, 2:16 AM - Misheel: idk i didnt watch any of the algebra 2 lectures
7/8/22, 2:16 AM - Misheel: i wouldnt know
7/8/22, 2:17 AM - Alex: Fair enough haha
7/8/22, 2:25 AM - Misheel: the joint that connects my foot and my ankle just cracked

7/8/22, 2:28 AM - Alex: Ridiculous
7/8/22, 2:29 AM - Alex: I'm 100% convinced you just have little bone fragments in your blood stream
7/8/22, 2:29 AM - Alex: From cracking so much
7/8/22, 2:29 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠

7/8/22, 4:13 PM - Alex: Maths with maths
7/8/22, 4:13 PM - Misheel: It‚Äôs ok they mostly have explanations for their biology-y terms
7/8/22, 4:13 PM - Misheel: some of them don‚Äôt
7/8/22, 4:13 PM - Misheel: but this girlie didnt do a level bio for nothing
7/8/22, 4:14 PM - Misheel: even tho she remembers nothing

7/8/22, 4:16 PM - Misheel: i had this memorised in my head for the exam
7/8/22, 4:16 PM - Alex: Right of course
7/8/22, 4:17 PM - Alex: Silly me thinking the paper was actually used for something, just remember everything
7/8/22, 4:17 PM - Misheel: some people made mind maps, some people made notes, i needed this combo to make sense of it
7/8/22, 4:17 PM - Misheel: map notes?
7/8/22, 4:18 PM - Alex: Map notes üò≠ how did you do 5 a levels
7/8/22, 4:18 PM - Misheel: no social life ü•∞
7/8/22, 4:18 PM - Alex: We did you decide to do 5 a levels
7/8/22, 4:18 PM - Alex: Me neither and I pretended to be a normal person academically anyway
7/8/22, 4:21 PM - Misheel: I did 4 at first without further maths
7/8/22, 4:22 PM - Misheel: then i asked my maths teacher if i could take further maths even if i had to self study
7/8/22, 4:22 PM - Misheel: and she was like sure i‚Äôll teach you further maths
7/8/22, 4:22 PM - Misheel: and at that point i didnt wanna drop anything

7/8/22, 4:23 PM - Alex: But in hs I didn't even take notes
7/8/22, 4:24 PM - Alex: I just remembered things
7/8/22, 4:24 PM - Misheel: i gave cmbyn girl all my booklets for her last year of sch
7/8/22, 4:24 PM - Misheel: she gave them back
7/8/22, 4:24 PM - Misheel: after the year was done and told me i saved her life

7/8/22, 4:28 PM - Misheel: ready for your meeting? :D
7/8/22, 4:30 PM - Alex: Would have been passed around a lot otherwise tho it'll be like the fountain of youth, everyone trying to get to the notes
7/8/22, 4:31 PM - Alex: I'm not sure, depends on what they're expecting of me
7/8/22, 4:32 PM - Alex: I'm emotionally prepared, whether I'm quantumly prepared is another question

7/8/22, 7:27 PM - Alex: You left
7/8/22, 7:27 PM - Alex: It says
7/8/22, 7:28 PM - Misheel: i did only after it froze for a minute
7/8/22, 7:28 PM - Alex: Yioy
7/8/22, 7:29 PM - Alex: Is Saulet gonna call you
7/8/22, 7:29 PM - Misheel: She called me while it was frozen

7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Misheel: i assumed you left the post office by now
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Misheel: and i used google maps
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Alex: Posting is a pain
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Misheel: oh no
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Misheel: i wouldnt know because we dont have proper post but yk
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Alex: You mentioned
7/8/22, 8:42 PM - Alex: But Im done now
7/8/22, 8:43 PM - Alex: It was really expensive ü•≤

7/8/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: You could do what Ethan did
7/8/22, 8:45 PM - Misheel: Give it early and make him wait a month lmaoo
7/8/22, 8:46 PM - Misheel: Gaurav has it in his room and was like ‚Äúhow am i gonna stop myself from opening it for a month‚Äù
7/8/22, 8:46 PM - Misheel: Omg I realised I‚Äôm gonna be so stressed
7/8/22, 8:46 PM - Misheel: Your birthday is 11 days after I come back from Mongolia
7/8/22, 8:47 PM - Misheel: Ok this is the last time I‚Äôll mention your birthday around you because otherwise it‚Äôs too close
7/8/22, 8:47 PM - Alex: Hahah
7/8/22, 8:47 PM - Alex: Okay
7/8/22, 8:48 PM - Alex: Doesn't this just mean I get a cool Mongolian present
7/8/22, 8:48 PM - Alex: It's lit
7/8/22, 8:48 PM - Misheel: I also need to figure out details of where I‚Äôm gonna take him
7/8/22, 8:48 PM - Misheel: Probably
7/8/22, 8:48 PM - Alex: ü•∂üç¶
7/8/22, 8:50 PM - Alex: Yeah probably smart

7/8/22, 10:27 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/8/22, 10:28 PM - Misheel: thats a lot
7/8/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: It is
7/8/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: But what I've read so far seems cool, even though I don't totally understand
7/8/22, 10:28 PM - Alex: So it's lit
7/8/22, 10:29 PM - Misheel: not totallt understanding is fine
7/8/22, 10:29 PM - Alex: How about totally not understanding
7/8/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: That might be a bit bad
7/8/22, 10:31 PM - Misheel: But you‚Äôll get there right
7/8/22, 10:31 PM - Alex: Probably
7/8/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: we take a probably
7/8/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: that‚Äôs good!
7/8/22, 10:32 PM - Alex: we do indeed take a probably
7/8/22, 10:32 PM - Alex: are you mocking me
7/8/22, 10:32 PM - Misheel: no
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: maybe the exclamation mark was a bit extra
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: but you cant blame me ive had to send several things w exclamation marks recently
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: so exclamation marks are kinda in my brain yk
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Alex: haha, ok I thought you were mimicking my thats good!
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Alex: whats with all the exclimation marks?
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Alex: I have covid !!! :D
7/8/22, 10:33 PM - Misheel: no as in
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: thank you!!
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: mostly
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: to internships
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: and get well soon wishes
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Alex: internship *s* üôÑ
7/8/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: i mean internship related emails
7/8/22, 10:35 PM - Alex: Okay fair enough, lots to be happy about üòÅü§†
7/8/22, 10:35 PM - Misheel: indeed
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Misheel: they keep playing this sound outside
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Misheel: it sounds like the beginning of the fire alarm
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Misheel: and then stop
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Misheel: and everytime it gives me a heart attack
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Alex: Oh no
7/8/22, 10:43 PM - Alex: Not again
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Alex: This happened in term 1 no?
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Misheel: no its not like that
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Alex: How many times has it happened
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Misheel: it happens once every 10 mins or sth
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Alex: And how many more times are you planning on being surprised by it
7/8/22, 10:44 PM - Misheel: and lasts for like 3 seconds
7/8/22, 10:46 PM - Alex: how long has it been going on for
7/8/22, 10:46 PM - Misheel: like 20 mins
7/8/22, 10:46 PM - Misheel: it had happened twice
7/8/22, 10:46 PM - Alex: so
7/8/22, 10:46 PM - Alex: twice?
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Alex: oh okay
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Misheel: Yes
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Alex: okay then its reasonable the be scared by that, i revoke my previous mockery
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Misheel: thanks
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Misheel: v appreciated
7/8/22, 10:47 PM - Alex: nws
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: better?
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: is it yioying
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: Yea
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: And i need to turn it down slightly
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Alex: As I'm in the library ü§ï
7/8/22, 11:33 PM - Misheel: was about to check
7/8/22, 11:34 PM - Alex: Lmaooo alexander üò≠üò≠, lmaoo, yoy is high praise for one of my bits
7/8/22, 11:34 PM - Alex: Not to be confused with one of my qubits
7/8/22, 11:35 PM - Misheel: mhm
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Alex: if i kms I won't need to understnad what this means
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Alex: problem solved
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Misheel: yoy
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Alex: the geometric interpretation is too hard üò≠
7/8/22, 11:44 PM - Misheel: what is going on
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: its a matrix that represnts a qubit gate
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Misheel: okay
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: so normie cringe computers have things like not
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: quantum computers have this hellscape
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: they don't normally use this formula
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: but still üò≠
7/8/22, 11:45 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/8/22, 11:46 PM - Misheel: are all of these angles im assuming ??
7/8/22, 11:46 PM - Alex: must do
7/8/22, 11:47 PM - Misheel: that is v complicated
7/8/22, 11:47 PM - Alex: it is
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Misheel: idk just take it at face value
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: oh i sitll have no idea what the sphere is for
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: each slice of the x-y plane represents the same probability distribution for the qubit
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Misheel: right
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: I have noidea why we need a sphere
7/8/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: why is there complex probability üò≠

7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: I get that this is 50/50 and you just absolute value it
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: but why do we need to be comlpex about things
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: this should be an email to my supervisor I think
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Misheel: i‚Äôm reading about the bloch sphere
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: oh ok
7/8/22, 11:51 PM - Alex: new supervisor üôÇ
7/8/22, 11:54 PM - Misheel: ok in conclusion i dont get it
7/8/22, 11:54 PM - Alex: oh okay sick
7/8/22, 11:54 PM - Alex: i got to that conclusion as well
7/8/22, 11:54 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 11:54 PM - Alex: glad we agree
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: honestly i‚Äôd take most of it and just accept it
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: for now
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: ask later
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: yeah thats what I've been doing
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: the bloch spheres aren't actually that bad I have the idea
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: its just really really hard to geometrically interpret it
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: in any amount of time that isnt' like 20 minutes
7/8/22, 11:56 PM - Alex: for like each problem
7/8/22, 11:56 PM - Misheel: yeah
7/8/22, 11:56 PM - Misheel: can imagine
7/8/22, 11:56 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 11:56 PM - Alex: and if you have r = 1 all the time then its a sphere
7/8/22, 11:57 PM - Alex: r = 1 all the time bc probability should add up to 1
7/8/22, 11:57 PM - Alex: i just dont know why alpha and beta are allowed to be complex
7/8/22, 11:57 PM - Misheel: yeah

7/9/22, 12:03 AM - Misheel: bby üò≠üò≠
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Alex: We have already seen that qubits are a system with discrete outputs 0 and 1, and yet can exist in states that can only be described by continuous parameters. This is a particular instance of the well-known notion of 'wave-particle' duality that is typical of quantum systems
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Alex: Yo this is sick
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Alex: sorry Im throwing quantum physics at you while your sick and its midnight
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Alex: but its cool :)
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Misheel: No it‚Äôs fine
7/9/22, 12:07 AM - Misheel: It is sick indeed
7/9/22, 12:10 AM - Misheel: have you figured out why you need 4 real numbers to describe them
7/9/22, 12:10 AM - Misheel: ie 2 complex numbers one for each 0 and 1?
7/9/22, 12:11 AM - Alex: yeah thats what I assume
7/9/22, 12:11 AM - Alex: you need two reals for each complex
7/9/22, 12:12 AM - Alex: everything ive read so far has been dealing with single qubits
7/9/22, 12:12 AM - Misheel: yeah but why do you need them
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Alex: not even gates between two of them
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: why not just yolo with 2 reals
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Alex: to do cool quantum stuff
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: what‚Äôs the 2d aspect
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Alex: I don't knowww üò≠
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: and be kinda continuous
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: yk
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Alex: it might have somethigin to do with polarization
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: right
7/9/22, 12:13 AM - Alex: ive explained bb84 to you right
7/9/22, 12:16 AM - Misheel: you probably have but i mightve forgotten that it was called bb84
7/9/22, 12:17 AM - Misheel: you have
7/9/22, 12:17 AM - Misheel: yeah
7/9/22, 12:17 AM - Misheel: i looked it up i remember u telling me about this
7/9/22, 12:18 AM - Alex: Yeah so probably that rotation is relevant for representing qubits in 3d
7/9/22, 12:18 AM - Alex: But idk
7/9/22, 12:19 AM - Misheel: that makes sense
7/9/22, 12:23 AM - Alex: No it doesn't üò≠
7/9/22, 12:23 AM - Alex: But the annoying but is they didn't mention any of this stuff
7/9/22, 12:23 AM - Alex: They just kinda threw complex probability at me
7/9/22, 12:23 AM - Alex: And called it a day
7/9/22, 12:23 AM - Misheel: right
7/9/22, 12:27 AM - Misheel: i googled complex probability and exotic probability popped up
7/9/22, 12:28 AM - Alex: Is that's something even more complicated or just a quirky adjective
7/9/22, 12:29 AM - Misheel: idk i didnt read it
7/9/22, 12:29 AM - Misheel: my phone is doing a weird thing where the volume goes up and down
7/9/22, 12:29 AM - Misheel: actually it doesnt
7/9/22, 12:29 AM - Misheel: like the physical volume just goes up and down
7/9/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: Are you covering the speaker
7/9/22, 12:30 AM - Misheel: no
7/9/22, 12:30 AM - Misheel: and it goes louder at random times
7/9/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: That's fun
7/9/22, 12:31 AM - Misheel: i know right
7/9/22, 12:31 AM - Alex: Add a bit of excitement to the phone usage
7/9/22, 12:32 AM - Misheel: ayaya
7/9/22, 12:33 AM - Alex: Ayayoi
7/9/22, 12:33 AM - Misheel: indeed
7/9/22, 12:38 AM - Misheel: i looked at my screentime
7/9/22, 12:38 AM - Misheel: this is genuinely disturbing

7/9/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: i was terrified
7/9/22, 12:44 AM - Misheel: to hear that
7/9/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: Oh my god
7/9/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: That's terrifying
7/9/22, 12:45 AM - Alex: Like upside down?
7/9/22, 12:45 AM - Misheel: yes

7/9/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: for different reasons
7/9/22, 12:51 AM - Misheel: its so squeaky
7/9/22, 12:52 AM - Misheel: and you think the whole thing‚Äôs gonna fall over at any minute

7/9/22, 12:57 AM - Misheel: The original paper that he gave me
7/9/22, 12:57 AM - Misheel: had code written using mathematica
7/9/22, 12:57 AM - Alex: ? The new person?
7/9/22, 12:57 AM - Alex: üôÑüôÑüôÑ
7/9/22, 12:58 AM - Misheel: yes

7/9/22, 12:59 AM - Misheel: and he was like ‚Äúsince you dont know mathematica i‚Äôll give you two options - learn mathematica and then use their code but slightly modified OR code it from scratch in python‚Äù then he was like ‚Äúi think the latter will be a better learning experience‚Äù and i dont think i‚Äôll need mathematica in my life later on so i picked python
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: Hmm
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: That's probably good
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: Python is v easy
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: Yeah
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: But this is more work right
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: Yeah
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: And now you won't know mathematica
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: I‚Äôm fine w not knowing mathematica
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Alex: Which might b more helpful for, you know, mathematics
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs a very applied maths thing to do
7/9/22, 1:00 AM - Misheel: it‚Äôs very numerical
7/9/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: Oh right
7/9/22, 1:01 AM - Alex: Cringe!!
7/9/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: I‚Äôm ok w using python

7/9/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: he said
7/9/22, 1:01 AM - Misheel: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking to produce similar results to paper x‚Äù
7/9/22, 1:02 AM - Misheel: and paper x has code
7/9/22, 1:02 AM - Misheel: so he was like you can do mathematica or python
7/9/22, 1:02 AM - Misheel: Also paper x is gonna be the death of me
7/9/22, 1:03 AM - Alex: You have to do a whole bio paper?
7/9/22, 1:03 AM - Alex: Can I call u in like 10?

7/9/22, 7:41 PM - Misheel: the incident was started by her

7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Alex: Crystal took her back?
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Misheel: no
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Misheel: the gc did
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Alex: She should have standards after being "besties" with you
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Alex: Ok good
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Misheel: crystal was p against it
7/9/22, 8:21 PM - Misheel: and then i talked to one of my other friends

7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: insane girlie üôÉ
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: crystal was v emotionally unstable when this girl returned
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: and we distanced ourselves from the gc
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: after that
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Alex: Mhmm
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Alex: Understandable
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Alex: Poor crystal üò¢
7/9/22, 8:23 PM - Misheel: then the girl left and we rejoined
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Alex: Good üò§
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: there were so many silly little fights
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: in the gc
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Alex: GC must be infinitely better without emotionally manipulator girl and with mishtal
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: and we were laughing about it like a year ago
7/9/22, 8:24 PM - Misheel: and i said sth like ‚Äúoh we fought about so many dumb things‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:25 PM - Misheel: and crystal was like ‚Äúremember anna‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:25 PM - Misheel: and i was like ‚Äúexcept for anna‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:25 PM - Alex: The GC would fight or you two would fight
7/9/22, 8:25 PM - Misheel: gc would fight
7/9/22, 8:26 PM - Alex: What's anna
7/9/22, 8:26 PM - Misheel: anna‚Äôs the name of the finnish girl
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Alex: Who crystal talked to?
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Misheel: yes
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Alex: Sorry I'm having a hard time keeping track of ppl
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Misheel: anna used to be in the gc
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Misheel: before i joined
7/9/22, 8:27 PM - Misheel: and crystal and anna were besties
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: then the whole anna fake cutting thing happened and anna left
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: i joined the gc days later
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: and then anna rejoined at some point
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: we left
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: anna leave
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: s
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: we rejoin
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Alex: Oh right sorry
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Misheel: last year crystal was like
7/9/22, 8:28 PM - Alex: Didn't realize Anna was the one doing all this
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: talking about how we fought
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: we as in the gc
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: and i was like ‚Äúyeah it was about dumb shit too that didnt matter at all‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: and then she was like
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: ‚Äúremember anna‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: and i was like
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Misheel: except for anna
7/9/22, 8:29 PM - Alex: Yeah that stuff is really bad
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Alex: Are you going to talk to your sister about being safe online
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Misheel: yeah
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Misheel: the thing is telling her not to is not gonna do anything üò≠üò≠
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Alex: She'll be okay she has a ex chronically online big sister who will help her
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Alex: Yeah I mean
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Alex: I doubt lecturing will do anything
7/9/22, 8:30 PM - Alex: But just like the internet is dangerous and you should come to me if anything is dodgy
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: and fanpages are a slippery slide
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Alex: Or maybe she needs to be a bit more mature for that idk
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: the thing is at that age you dont realise its dodgy
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: i would have never come to anyone w that
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: bc then they wouldve told me to cut contact
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Misheel: which tbh i would tell my sister now
7/9/22, 8:31 PM - Alex: Yeah that'd fair
7/9/22, 8:32 PM - Misheel: do you see the problem here
7/9/22, 8:32 PM - Alex: Yeah
7/9/22, 8:32 PM - Alex: But I feel like as her sister instead of mother
7/9/22, 8:32 PM - Alex: She might be more willing
7/9/22, 8:32 PM - Alex: Esp because you did the same thing
7/9/22, 8:33 PM - Misheel: the things that i would have wanted to hear and the only things that wouldve made me come to someone are things that as an adult i could never tell a child yk?
7/9/22, 8:33 PM - Misheel: like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs gonna be fine you just keep comforting them and bla bla‚Äù
7/9/22, 8:33 PM - Misheel: i cant say that now
7/9/22, 8:34 PM - Misheel: hopefully
7/9/22, 8:34 PM - Misheel: but somehow doubt it
7/9/22, 8:34 PM - Misheel: ?
7/9/22, 8:34 PM - Misheel: what was that
7/9/22, 10:23 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>

7/9/22, 10:23 PM - Misheel: BANGER
7/9/22, 10:34 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/9/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: so ive come to the conclusion
7/9/22, 11:09 PM - Misheel: the only way to stop this emotional rollercoaster is to press ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù everytime a couple thing pops up
7/9/22, 11:09 PM - Alex: Oh okay
7/9/22, 11:09 PM - Alex: Nws I'll send you stuff üòÅüòÅüòÅ

7/9/22, 11:10 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/9/22, 11:10 PM - Misheel: not if it‚Äôs up and down in 30 min intervals
7/9/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: Wdym more fun that way
7/9/22, 11:11 PM - Alex: Unless the rollercoaster stalls upside down ü•≤

Then his nephew who‚Äôs currently living with him suggests looking for it in his laundry and the guy goes ‚Äúi would never leave it in the laundry‚Äù but it is in the laundry.
7/10/22, 12:45 AM - Misheel: Which made me think of you putting your airpods in the laundry üò≠üò≠üò≠

7/11/22, 9:04 PM - Misheel: And my maths teacher was not at school
7/11/22, 9:04 PM - Misheel: And so instead of doing maths I was just laying with my head down on the desk
7/11/22, 9:04 PM - Misheel: and he walks in from the other classroom
7/11/22, 9:04 PM - Misheel: and asks if I can explain sth to him
7/11/22, 9:04 PM - Alex: Oh no
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Misheel: And I was so tired and ill
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Alex: You're dead on the desk and he asks specifically you for help
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Misheel: I was alone in the classroom
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Misheel: and he went to find me to ask me for help
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Alex: Oh okay fair enough
7/11/22, 9:05 PM - Misheel: I dont think I was visibly ill

7/11/22, 9:06 PM - Misheel: not because of him
7/11/22, 9:06 PM - Misheel: but he clearly thinks its cause of him
7/11/22, 9:06 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/11/22, 9:06 PM - Misheel: and he‚Äôs like
7/11/22, 9:07 PM - Misheel: if you dont want to help that‚Äôs okay

7/11/22, 9:08 PM - Alex: Nobody is allowed to say no to that
7/11/22, 9:08 PM - Misheel: And I keep on sighing

7/17/22, 2:43 PM - Misheel: pain
7/17/22, 2:43 PM - Alex: Oh no
7/17/22, 2:43 PM - Alex: Are you hobbling
7/17/22, 2:43 PM - Misheel: I have resorted to standing
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Alex: Just standing ominously
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Misheel: Yes
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Alex: Haha sounds good
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Misheel: ok its fine now
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Misheel: walking again
7/17/22, 2:44 PM - Alex: ü•∂üç¶
7/17/22, 2:47 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 2:47 PM - Alex: Birds of some sort üòç
7/17/22, 2:48 PM - Misheel: i think its a type of goose
7/17/22, 2:48 PM - Alex: :)
7/17/22, 3:10 PM - Misheel: its so hit
7/17/22, 3:10 PM - Misheel: hot
7/17/22, 3:27 PM - Misheel: I tried to go into torrington place
7/17/22, 3:27 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs locked
7/17/22, 3:27 PM - Misheel: omg i am so sick of my id card never working anywhere
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: I appreciate it though
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: Like I tried to go in the torrington gates and
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: It didnt let me in
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: The security was like just go
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: Then the study space was locked
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: Bro what
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Alex: Lmao Why'd he let you in
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: torrington lift
7/17/22, 4:05 PM - Misheel: idk
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: Oh big bag
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Misheel: Saulet‚Äôs bag that she left behind
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Misheel: lmao
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: Very nice fit
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Misheel: danke
7/17/22, 4:06 PM - Alex: Right lmao
7/17/22, 4:07 PM - Alex: How was the paper
7/17/22, 4:07 PM - Misheel: Still doing it
7/17/22, 4:07 PM - Misheel: Yoy
7/17/22, 4:07 PM - Alex: Yoy
7/17/22, 4:17 PM - Misheel: I am in the cruciform no eating area and I am eating
7/17/22, 4:17 PM - Misheel: And these girls just stared at me and left
7/17/22, 4:26 PM - Misheel: Ok I‚Äôm p much done ü•≥
7/17/22, 4:26 PM - Misheel: Yooy
7/17/22, 4:29 PM - Misheel: nvm
7/17/22, 4:42 PM - Alex: ü§©
7/17/22, 4:42 PM - Alex: Lmao üò•
7/17/22, 4:42 PM - Alex: Lmaoooo slay
7/17/22, 4:42 PM - Misheel: I left anyways
7/17/22, 4:42 PM - Misheel: Cause there‚Äôs a bit
7/17/22, 4:43 PM - Misheel: Which I think either a) my supervisor overlooked
7/17/22, 4:43 PM - Misheel: because i‚Äôm defo sure the thing that i did was right
7/17/22, 4:43 PM - Misheel: But there‚Äôs a small bit missing
7/17/22, 4:43 PM - Misheel: i proved that F^5 has a fixed point
7/17/22, 4:43 PM - Alex: Yeah it's your supervisor that's wrong not you
7/17/22, 4:44 PM - Misheel: just need to prove that it isnt the same as the fixed point of F
7/17/22, 4:44 PM - Misheel: I didnt mean it like that üò≠
7/17/22, 4:45 PM - Misheel: So I need to do that and then it‚Äôs def complete
7/17/22, 4:45 PM - Alex: Nice ü•∞ well done
7/17/22, 4:45 PM - Misheel: And to do that I need to prove that there are not infinitely many fixed points
7/17/22, 4:46 PM - Misheel: sometimes she just makes me assume things in the end and it might be one of those
7/17/22, 4:46 PM - Misheel: bc this seems unlikely
7/17/22, 4:46 PM - Misheel: and that‚Äôs not even the condition
7/17/22, 4:46 PM - Alex: Why don't you just prove this
7/17/22, 4:47 PM - Misheel: you need to prove that there are not infinitely many that are arbitrarily close to a certain point
7/17/22, 4:47 PM - Misheel: we‚Äôre not given the function
7/17/22, 4:47 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs an arbitrary function
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Alex: Oh
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Alex: That makes it harder
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: I‚Äôm trying to imagine it and it just isnt working out in my head
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: Actually
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: I think I‚Äôve got it
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: Omg
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: I‚Äôm walking
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Misheel: and figured it out
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Alex: You're only given info about a few points but you need to prove it's not fixed nearby?
7/17/22, 4:48 PM - Alex: It's lit
7/17/22, 4:49 PM - Alex: Do tell
7/17/22, 4:49 PM - Misheel: a function has a point w period 5
7/17/22, 4:49 PM - Misheel: and another function is v close to said function
7/17/22, 4:50 PM - Misheel: if you imagine the graph of both of these functions
7/17/22, 4:50 PM - Misheel: and y=x
7/17/22, 4:50 PM - Misheel: you realise that if you have infinitely many points then you need to keep crossing y=x
7/17/22, 4:50 PM - Alex: Uhhhh
7/17/22, 4:50 PM - Misheel: and that doesn‚Äôt make sense in terms of having a periodic point of period 5
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Misheel: infinitely many fixed points
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Misheel: at the fixed points the graph intersects y=x
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Alex: Fixed points have to cross y=X?
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Misheel: yes
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Misheel: because f(x)=x
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Alex: Right, but what about period 5 fixed points
7/17/22, 4:51 PM - Alex: Or are fixed points only when it's period 1
7/17/22, 4:52 PM - Misheel: fixed points only when its period 1
7/17/22, 4:52 PM - Alex: Ok
7/17/22, 4:52 PM - Misheel: if you have a fixed point of f^5 then it‚Äôs either a fixed point of f or a periodic point w period 5 of f
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Alex: Wait really?
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Misheel: yes
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Alex: Just for this function? Or always
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Misheel: always
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Alex: Isn't that wacky
7/17/22, 4:53 PM - Misheel: cause f^5(x)=x
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: so either f(x)=x
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: or f^5(x)=x for the first time after applying f 5 times
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: because 5 is prime
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: if it was 6
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: then it would be
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Misheel: either x has period 1, 2, 3 or 6
7/17/22, 4:54 PM - Alex: Wait
7/17/22, 4:55 PM - Alex: It's is f‚Åµ(X) the function to the 5th power or the function applied 5 times
7/17/22, 4:55 PM - Misheel: applied 5 times
7/17/22, 4:55 PM - Alex: Ohhhhh okay yeah that makes sense
7/17/22, 4:56 PM - Alex: Got it got it
7/17/22, 4:56 PM - Alex: That's cool
7/17/22, 4:57 PM - Alex: And so you need to prove that there isn't infinitely many fixed points (period 1) to show the period 5 is a legit period 5 and u do this by saying the graph isn't y = x
7/17/22, 4:57 PM - Alex: ?
7/17/22, 4:57 PM - Misheel: Kind of
7/17/22, 4:57 PM - Misheel: so if there‚Äôs infinitely many fixed points around it then it needs to keep crossing it
7/17/22, 4:57 PM - Misheel: so oscillating around y=x somewhere
7/17/22, 4:58 PM - Alex: Mhmm
7/17/22, 4:58 PM - Misheel: but it‚Äôs also v close to said function which has a fixed point of period 5
7/17/22, 4:58 PM - Misheel: so if you formalise that
7/17/22, 4:58 PM - Misheel: it should give some type of contradiction
7/17/22, 4:59 PM - Misheel: i need to think more about it
7/17/22, 4:59 PM - Misheel: but i think thats the general idea
7/17/22, 4:59 PM - Alex: Why can't the period 5 point also be chilling near y=x
7/17/22, 4:59 PM - Misheel: Yeah that‚Äôs what I need to figure out
7/17/22, 5:00 PM - Misheel: But I think this is the correct way to fo
7/17/22, 5:00 PM - Alex: Me too!
7/17/22, 5:00 PM - Misheel: Danke
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Misheel: at gongcha and they dont have pearls
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Alex: ???? üò≠
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Misheel: Also I need to stop spending money
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Alex: That's like
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Misheel: But I wanted sth cold
7/17/22, 5:04 PM - Misheel: And I said it was ok
7/17/22, 5:05 PM - Alex: Their whole thing
7/17/22, 5:05 PM - Misheel: I know right??
7/17/22, 5:05 PM - Alex: While you were explaining maths to me were you just standing in the middle of Gower Street
7/17/22, 5:06 PM - Misheel: tcr
7/17/22, 5:07 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 5:07 PM - Alex: Idk the street names lmao
7/17/22, 5:07 PM - Misheel: lmaoo
7/17/22, 5:08 PM - Misheel: tottenham court road
7/17/22, 5:08 PM - Misheel: üò≠
7/17/22, 5:08 PM - Alex: Oh I knew that üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
7/17/22, 5:08 PM - Alex: Just couldn't tell by looking at maps
7/17/22, 5:08 PM - Alex: So I guessed one of the UCL streets
7/17/22, 5:09 PM - Misheel: ah ok
7/17/22, 5:47 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 7:57 PM - Misheel: are you guys still on call?
7/17/22, 7:57 PM - Alex: Yep
7/17/22, 7:58 PM - Misheel: add me back?
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: also
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs kinda late ish
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: So i think we‚Äôll have to do everything all at once later
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Misheel: üò≠
7/17/22, 10:07 PM - Alex: Fun üòÅüòÅ

7/17/22, 10:08 PM - Misheel: okay
7/17/22, 10:17 PM - Alex: What is this
7/17/22, 10:17 PM - Misheel: It‚Äôs a crossword type of thing
7/17/22, 10:17 PM - Misheel: chalkdust magazine
7/17/22, 10:17 PM - Misheel: stole one from the open day
7/17/22, 10:18 PM - Alex: Ohhh chalkdust fun
7/17/22, 10:18 PM - Misheel: aka asked robert ‚Äúis it ok if i take one‚Äù
7/17/22, 10:18 PM - Alex: Lmaoooo ofc you did
7/17/22, 10:18 PM - Misheel: ü•∞

7/17/22, 10:19 PM - Alex: Does he have an internship or something
7/17/22, 10:19 PM - Misheel: is this kensington gardens?
7/17/22, 10:20 PM - Alex: I have no idea
7/17/22, 10:20 PM - Misheel: idk
7/17/22, 10:20 PM - Alex: Distinctly possible
7/17/22, 11:32 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 11:45 PM - Alex: Sorry I had to leave so abruptly
7/17/22, 11:46 PM - Misheel: don‚Äôt worry
7/17/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: Sort of sorry for sprining all this on you, take as much time as you need to figure it out
7/17/22, 11:48 PM - Alex: This feels to sombre for what happened
7/17/22, 11:48 PM - Misheel: Okay :)
7/17/22, 11:48 PM - Misheel: lmaoo
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: Leo's driving
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: This is worrying
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Misheel: Oh
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Misheel: He doesn‚Äôt have his driver‚Äôs license right?
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Misheel: Or does he
7/17/22, 11:50 PM - Alex: He does
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Misheel: Daniel is the driver
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Misheel: most of the time
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Alex: But hes never drove more than 10 minutes he said üò≠
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Misheel: Is he gonna drive for more than 10 mins?
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Alex: Ye
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Alex: It's an hour away üò≠
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Misheel: it‚Äôs ok i‚Äôll track you
7/17/22, 11:51 PM - Misheel: Ok maybe not for the whole hour
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Misheel: But
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Misheel: If you die then you‚Äôll be in one place
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Alex: üò≠üò≠
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Misheel: and that probably wont be inside a restaurant
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Misheel: soo
7/17/22, 11:52 PM - Alex: Okay sorry if I die
7/17/22, 11:53 PM - Misheel: Yeah you‚Äôd actually have to be sorry for that
7/17/22, 11:53 PM - Misheel: Springing all of this on me and then dying??!
7/17/22, 11:53 PM - Alex: Yeah that'd be rude
7/17/22, 11:53 PM - Misheel: Emotional damage 100
7/17/22, 11:54 PM - Alex: Lmaooo unenessesary
7/17/22, 11:54 PM - Alex: Spelling is hard üò¢
7/17/22, 11:54 PM - Misheel: mhm
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: I have more questions
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: Go ahead
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: But I feel like those are better on call haha
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: Ok
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Misheel: one was
7/17/22, 11:55 PM - Alex: You can wait for call too
7/17/22, 11:56 PM - Misheel: But that‚Äôs v late üò≠
7/17/22, 11:56 PM - Misheel: And I have a meeting
7/17/22, 11:56 PM - Alex: Right üò¢
7/17/22, 11:56 PM - Alex: Up to you üòÅ
7/17/22, 11:57 PM - Misheel: Is this why you asked me what my parents would think of a foreign boyfriend üò≠üò≠ lmaooo
7/17/22, 11:57 PM - Alex: No
7/17/22, 11:57 PM - Alex: But it was in my mind üò≠
7/17/22, 11:57 PM - Misheel: Fair
7/17/22, 11:57 PM - Alex: When you're on call for 4 hours a day things come up ü§∑
7/17/22, 11:58 PM - Misheel: I genuinely thought you didn‚Äôt when Huaiyi said we have chemistry and you said all your homies hate chemistry
7/17/22, 11:59 PM - Misheel: Because I was thinking hmm maybe before then and then as soon as you said ‚Äúall my homies hate chemistry‚Äù i was like nvm
7/17/22, 11:59 PM - Alex: that was just my distain for the subject
7/17/22, 11:59 PM - Alex: üò≠ kms
7/17/22, 11:59 PM - Alex: Sorry lmao
7/17/22, 11:59 PM - Misheel: It‚Äôs okay
7/18/22, 12:04 AM - Misheel: I was also v careful w the Jake and Amy references üò≠
7/18/22, 12:04 AM - Misheel: omg
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Misheel: It stayed on sent for a while
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Misheel: and I thought you‚Äôd actually died
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Misheel: instead of delivered
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Alex: Lmao sorry
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Alex: Yeahhhh because you say I'm like Jake all the time and you're like Amy
7/18/22, 12:05 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Alex: And like, that entirely independent from anything else
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Misheel: I was trying not to say that I‚Äôm like Amy too often
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Misheel: But I really am an Amy
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Alex: Yeah I noticed this actually lmao
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Alex: Suspiciously infrequently
7/18/22, 12:06 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠ omg
7/18/22, 12:07 AM - Alex: Indeed
7/18/22, 12:08 AM - Alex: Only suspiciously infrequently because I was overthinking everything
7/18/22, 12:08 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠
7/18/22, 12:08 AM - Misheel: yooy
7/18/22, 12:10 AM - Alex: Oh wait I totally lied I was stressed about this the other day too
7/18/22, 12:11 AM - Alex: Sorry lmao, it wasn't the whole time but like I'd be tired and just chilling on call and I'd sort of think about that stuff and feel a bit "ugh life is too hard"
7/18/22, 12:13 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠üò≠
7/18/22, 12:14 AM - Misheel: tbf it is complicated yoy
7/18/22, 12:15 AM - Misheel: also I have no concept of distance
7/18/22, 12:15 AM - Misheel: when you‚Äôve moved a bit on google maps
7/18/22, 12:15 AM - Misheel: idk how much you‚Äôve actually moved
7/18/22, 12:15 AM - Alex: It's very far, suburbia is wack
7/18/22, 12:16 AM - Alex: I'm moving more than the diameter of London
7/18/22, 12:16 AM - Misheel: Mhm
7/18/22, 12:24 AM - Misheel: I keep having to adjust my zoom
7/18/22, 12:24 AM - Misheel: also your battery is v low
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Alex: ?
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Misheel: As in
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Misheel: Zoom on google maps
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Misheel: Not zoom the meeting app
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Alex: Yeah üò≠
7/18/22, 12:26 AM - Alex: Ohhh lmao
7/18/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: <Media omitted>

7/18/22, 12:32 AM - Misheel: are you gonna cross uc berkeley?
7/18/22, 12:33 AM - Alex: Maybe? It's in Berkeley
7/18/22, 12:33 AM - Alex: Great China is the restaurant
7/18/22, 12:34 AM - Misheel: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 12:34 AM - Alex: Mhmm
7/18/22, 12:40 AM - Misheel: 1%
7/18/22, 12:40 AM - Misheel: yooy
7/18/22, 12:40 AM - Misheel: there also may or may not have been a reason why i stopped myself from bro-ing you the other day
7/18/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: üò≠ that's cute
7/18/22, 12:43 AM - Alex: Then you had to take my harrasment for that

7/18/22, 9:33 AM - Alex: Okay I am genuinely kind of sorry this isn't at the best time, but it's kind of no time is a good time for more problems and another big reason is if I sit on my feelings much longer they'll only get worse

7/18/22, 9:34 AM - Misheel: It‚Äôs okay

7/18/22, 9:35 AM - Misheel: But then I feel like speaking it into the universe that something bad is gonna happen is not good

7/20/22, 8:35 PM - Alex: But I've watched the music video and I got the vibe
7/20/22, 8:35 PM - Alex: Sounds very cute
7/20/22, 8:35 PM - Misheel: Let me translate
7/20/22, 8:40 PM - Alex: Cute + Mongolian reminded me of you so I sent the screenshot btw
7/20/22, 8:47 PM - Alex: <Media omitted>
7/20/22, 8:47 PM - Misheel: I didn‚Äôt look for ten straight fingers (_ie perfection_), only looked for five fingers
You didn‚Äôt have many faults
You only had your lips (_lips and faults rhyme_)
You took my queen back and my harsh words
Clung on to you
And then we melted like chas tas (_explosion sound in mongolian_)
Melted melted melted baby
Yeah yeah
Melted, I‚Äôm selfish (_word means I‚Äôm selfish/possessive of you_)
Yeah yeah
Melted Melted baby
Baby baby-by-by ooh
There‚Äôs a lot of mirrors in your room that show my love
Start spelling out the love alphabet come on A B
My hands in your pocket
Armaanchik (_cute way of mispronouncing romantic_)
You‚Äôre frozen/stuck above (_basically she means you‚Äôre stunned_)
As you walk behind me 
I‚Äôm only emo for you
A demon to others
For me you‚Äôre lemon (_in mongolian_) lemon (_in english_)
When we‚Äôre together it‚Äôs like Bumba Timon
I‚Äôm so possessive of you
*repeats stuff i‚Äôve translated earlier*
Sometimes I need you filled with hugs ( _filled with hugs is an adjective here describing you_)
When the few words I dedicated to you reach you
Have a duty to heal not hurt
Not with anyone, just here next to you
Sometimes I don‚Äôt suck on the candy in my mouth but bite on it
Sometimes I don‚Äôt push away the tongue in my mouth but pull it in
I don‚Äôt like pictures being taken of me
I‚Äôm kind of shy and quiet
But I‚Äôll go crazy sometimes, won‚Äôt hide it
Biting on my pen quietly
Everyone except for you (_in english_) go go
Being quiet next to you is impossible no no
no no
I‚Äôm a fucking antisocial
Put me inside and lock me in
If I‚Äôm with you, 100 years are not enough
*repeats stuff i‚Äôve translated earlier*
7/20/22, 8:47 PM - Misheel: that‚Äôs was v long

7/28/22, 3:41 PM - Misheel: taagaagui:
you saying ‚Äúlater‚Äù never ends
you always postponing everything makes no sense to me
they way you are later is unsatisfying to my feelings (idk how to translate it nonawkwardly lmao)
you‚Äôre the best at putting me last
when i think about it now you didn‚Äôt show me love
you don‚Äôt pay me even a little attention
you don‚Äôt notice my suffering
your interest became different and i didnt guess it
i didnt guess it
you‚Äôre not playing are you
i didnt guess it
you‚Äôre not _word that‚Äôs kind of like being picky/rejecting something because you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good enough_ me
right?
i need you
please hug me tight
the days i spent with you are like a dream
i just woke up
from that horrible dream
the days i spent with you are like a dream
i need you every second
i have made so many sacrifices for you
you did not take the path i expected you to
i never guessed what you were thinking
*repeats stuff from earlier*

8/1/22, 7:18 AM - Misheel: at least it‚Äôs working lmao üò≠
8/1/22, 7:18 AM - Misheel: i‚Äôd cry if i didn‚Äôt get those fixed points and had to go into a meeting w linus like that
8/1/22, 7:19 AM - Alex: now you have something to show for
8/1/22, 7:19 AM - Alex: its lit
8/1/22, 7:20 AM - Misheel: mhm
8/1/22, 7:29 AM - Misheel: yoy
8/1/22, 7:30 AM - Alex: is the blue line supposed to look like that
8/1/22, 7:31 AM - Alex: yoy what
8/1/22, 7:31 AM - Misheel: i think it‚Äôs just steep because it‚Äôs the nullclines
8/1/22, 7:31 AM - Misheel: and also this is on a log scale
8/1/22, 7:31 AM - Misheel: i‚Äôm a bit ehh as to why it looks like it‚Äôs overlapping
8/1/22, 7:31 AM - Alex: Ah right that's cool
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Alex: Is it overlapping? Or just close
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: i think it‚Äôs overlapping
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: but either way thats fine
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: its not a function
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Alex: Is it not?
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: because it‚Äôs just the points where d(mF)/dt is stable
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Alex: Uh I don't get it
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: actually
8/1/22, 7:32 AM - Misheel: wait
8/1/22, 7:33 AM - Misheel: how‚Äôd i define it
8/1/22, 7:33 AM - Misheel: ok maybe it shouldnt overlap
8/1/22, 7:33 AM - Misheel: i think it might just be close
8/1/22, 7:33 AM - Misheel: but either way fixed points seem roughly right
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Alex: its tooo  lit
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Alex: i mean it is vertical in a lot of places
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Alex: bc of nullclines right
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Misheel: yes
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Misheel: i hope so
8/1/22, 7:36 AM - Misheel: my god

8/1/22, 7:44 AM - Alex: well done
8/1/22, 7:44 AM - Misheel: i am slightly concerned bc there should be a fixed point near 10^3 and 10^4 ish

8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Misheel: maybe the approximation is not good enough?
8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Misheel: idk?
8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Misheel: anyways i found that fixed point using a different method
8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Alex: can you make it so if the graphs are close it says they are in contact
8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Alex: and it makes a fixed point
8/1/22, 7:46 AM - Misheel: hmmm

8/1/22, 7:53 AM - Misheel: idk why it doesnt come out as a fixed point
8/1/22, 7:53 AM - Misheel: probably something wrong w the code

8/1/22, 7:54 AM - Alex: Nah it's to do with the computer you wrote the code so it must be right
8/1/22, 7:54 AM - Alex: It's lit

8/7/22, 10:05 AM - Misheel: and she‚Äôs like
8/7/22, 10:05 AM - Misheel: you‚Äôre too german
8/7/22, 10:05 AM - Misheel: you need clarity
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Misheel: you should think more openly
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Alex: ???
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Alex: Clarity for the thing she wants üôÑ
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Misheel: I know
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Alex: That's not how clarity works
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Misheel: And my mum is totally on my sister‚Äôs side
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Misheel: Indra asked me which Jeans I got for her
8/7/22, 10:06 AM - Misheel: I was like

8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Misheel: Also the photo has multiple designs on it
8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Misheel: If she doesnt tell me anything specific how am I supposed to tell
8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Alex: Yeah she also could have specified in that situation
8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Alex: You didn't ask which one to get
8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Alex: Just how do they look
8/7/22, 10:07 AM - Misheel: My mum said I should‚Äôve asked if I wasn‚Äôt sure
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Misheel: I was supposed to be the one asking apparently
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Misheel: yoy
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Alex: It's ok isn't a response to how do they look
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Alex: It's ok it's just generally dismissive
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Misheel: I know right üò≠
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Misheel: Omg
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Alex: Ridiculous behaviour
8/7/22, 10:08 AM - Misheel: I thought I was going insane
8/7/22, 10:09 AM - Alex: Also you should be the one making sure and clarifying when you're getting stuff for her üôÑ
8/7/22, 10:10 AM - Misheel: yooy
8/7/22, 10:10 AM - Misheel: I love having a supportive boyfriend
8/7/22, 10:10 AM - Alex: ü•∞
8/7/22, 10:10 AM - Alex: Glad to help
8/7/22, 10:11 AM - Misheel: Also all of this could‚Äôve been avoided if she had just spoken to me in Mongolian
8/7/22, 10:11 AM - Misheel: ^ ok maybe not
8/7/22, 10:11 AM - Misheel: But I am generally annoyed at how much English she uses ngl
8/7/22, 10:11 AM - Alex: Why's that
8/7/22, 10:11 AM - Alex: English is good ü§†
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: It‚Äôs because she will exchange a basic Mongolian word with the English word for it
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Alex: She's going to be fluent in mongolian, she lives there picking up English is just a bonus
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: It‚Äôs not like some of the ones that you dont really have in Mongolian
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: Like ‚Äúawkward‚Äù is fine to say in English bc we dont rly have a word
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna *english* trust *english ends* you anymore‚Äù
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: I asked why she‚Äôs doing that
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: and she‚Äôs like
8/7/22, 10:12 AM - Misheel: I forgot the Mongolian word
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Alex: Does "get noobed" translate nicely?
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: ???? What do you mean you forgot the Mongolian word
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: lmaooo
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Alex: ???
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: she forgot the word for trust
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: what üò≠
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Alex: üò≠üò≠
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Alex: Oh no
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: This is not good
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Misheel: And like
8/7/22, 10:13 AM - Alex: But there's no way
8/7/22, 10:14 AM - Alex: She doesn't become fluent in mongolian living in Mongolia
8/7/22, 10:14 AM - Alex: It's fine
8/7/22, 10:14 AM - Alex: (copium)
8/7/22, 10:14 AM - Alex: Plus that means she can talk to me when I come visit ü•∞üôÑüôÑ
8/7/22, 10:15 AM - Alex: ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞*
8/7/22, 10:15 AM - Misheel: You know like it‚Äôs fine if she wants to speak English and stuff w anyone else
8/7/22, 10:15 AM - Misheel: Like
8/7/22, 10:15 AM - Misheel: Just not with me
8/7/22, 10:15 AM - Misheel: If she wants to do it at school or anywhere it‚Äôs fine
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Alex: Mhmm alright I get that
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Misheel: And it‚Äôs good to have a clear separation between home language and not home language
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Misheel: I say this even though I speak a mix of German and Mongolian
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Misheel: But if I speak a mix I will switch inbetween sentences
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Misheel: not random words
8/7/22, 10:16 AM - Alex: Ich bein ein auto üòç

8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Alex: keeps saying

8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Misheel: üò≠üò≠üò≠
8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Misheel: lmaoo
8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Misheel: maths
8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Alex: . It is easy to see that Q is
a projector onto the vector space spanned by |k + 1‚ü©,..., |d‚ü©
8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Alex: NO IT ISN'T
8/9/22, 1:15 AM - Alex: I have no idea how they decided this
8/9/22, 1:16 AM - Misheel: lmaooo
8/9/22, 1:16 AM - Misheel: God
8/9/22, 1:17 AM - Misheel: sorry that linear algebra is being mean to u üò≠
8/9/22, 1:17 AM - Alex: also I'm starting to think that this book is making up its own defitions
8/9/22, 1:17 AM - Alex: because its being useless so I look up examples and I can't find anything like it
8/9/22, 1:17 AM - Misheel: oh no
8/9/22, 1:17 AM - Alex: and was the inner product in C^n always the complex conjugate of the elements of the second vector?
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: I don't think so
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: and then they make the outer product a tensor product? I think?
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Misheel: You can define inner products differently
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Misheel: as long as they follow some rules
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: and also use the conjugate of the second one there, but don't bother saying it at any point
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: yeah I know
8/9/22, 1:18 AM - Alex: I looked at the rules
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: I suppose (|v‚ü©, |w‚ü©)=(|w‚ü©, |v‚ü©)* should have given it away
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: becuase dot products are independent of order
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: but idk
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: maybe right now isn't the best time to be asking about this stuff
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Misheel: idk braket notation
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Misheel: sorry honey
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Misheel: yeah
8/9/22, 1:19 AM - Alex: |v> is just a vector
8/9/22, 1:20 AM - Misheel: I mean I‚Äôm still in the queue
8/9/22, 1:22 AM - Misheel: Apparently my dad is here
8/9/22, 1:22 AM - Misheel: It was unclear whether he would show up or not
8/9/22, 1:22 AM - Alex: uhhhhh
8/9/22, 1:22 AM - Alex: this is super positioned between good and bad until I get your take on it
8/9/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: lmaooo

8/9/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: i think it‚Äôs neutral
8/9/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: cause it wouldve been bad if he didnt
8/9/22, 1:24 AM - Alex: Don't ask me on my position tho, it will have to collapse then
8/9/22, 1:24 AM - Misheel: but now it‚Äôs gonna be awkward

8/28/22, 12:29 AM - Misheel: Yeah

8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Misheel: Oh he said that??
8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Misheel: He asked me during the _conversation_ what I thought
8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: but he'll be _cagey_ with things beacause I didn't tell him about you and that'll be the change in dynamic
8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: which like
8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Alex: I think thats fair
8/28/22, 12:30 AM - Misheel: Yeah

8/31/22, 10:52 AM - Alex: Yeah

8/31/22, 10:53 AM - Misheel: We should try to wait though I think

9/2/22, 6:30 AM - Misheel: ok babe
9/2/22, 6:30 AM - Misheel: thank you ü§çü§ç
9/2/22, 6:33 AM - Alex: its kind of expensive üò≠
9/2/22, 6:33 AM - Alex: 25 pounds per person for round trip
9/2/22, 6:33 AM - Alex: 12 pound train ride ? not horrible I guess
9/2/22, 6:34 AM - Misheel: üò≠
9/2/22, 6:34 AM - Misheel: my dad is driving me to my sis‚Äô school
9/2/22, 6:45 AM - Alex: we need to get to the airport at like 5-6am
9/2/22, 6:45 AM - Alex: bc flight is at 7:15
9/2/22, 6:45 AM - Alex: trains don't run that early
9/2/22, 6:45 AM - Alex: so I think we have to stay overnight
9/2/22, 6:45 AM - Alex: or get an uber
9/2/22, 6:47 AM - Alex: oh wait they totally do run that early
9/2/22, 6:47 AM - Alex: idk what I'm talking about lmao
9/2/22, 7:03 AM - Alex: ok
9/2/22, 7:03 AM - Alex: I think we bus
9/2/22, 7:04 AM - Alex: because to take the stanstead express that early we need to take a night bus to liverpool street then take a really early one
9/2/22, 7:04 AM - Alex: and that adds up to about how long the bus straight from mabrle arch takes and we can just sort of pass out on that one
9/2/22, 7:04 AM - Alex: so I think its chill if we do that
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: and then we can take the stanstead express back? but idk maybe we just take the coach again at that point
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: oh wait its not cheaper
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: because its at a god forsaken hour so its expensive
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: but oh well
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: I can't book that far in advance tho for the bus
9/2/22, 7:05 AM - Alex: so we can wait on that
9/2/22, 7:07 AM - Alex: but I think we take the bus from marble arch to stanstead for 16 pounds (kms)
9/2/22, 7:07 AM - Alex: then we take the train back
9/2/22, 7:08 AM - Alex: yeah but we can book that later
9/2/22, 7:08 AM - Alex: agreed!
9/2/22, 7:10 AM - Misheel: Okay
9/2/22, 7:10 AM - Misheel: Right

9/2/22, 7:51 AM - Alex: Not sure that'll work
9/2/22, 7:51 AM - Alex: Because of constant _stimulatuon_
9/2/22, 7:51 AM - Misheel: Oh does it only work in minor cases?
9/2/22, 7:51 AM - Alex: Like trying to put out a stove fire with water, will just keep lighting back up yk
